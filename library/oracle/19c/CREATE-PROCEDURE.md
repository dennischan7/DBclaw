# Oracle 19c - CREATE-PROCEDURE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/CREATE-PROCEDURE.html

Purpose

Procedures are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01373) for details of syntax and semantics.

Use the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement to create a standalone stored procedure or a call specification.

A procedure is a group of PL/SQL statements that you can call by name. A call specification (sometimes called call spec) declares a Java method or a third-generation language (3GL) routine so that it can be called from SQL and PL/SQL. The call spec tells Oracle Database which Java method to invoke when a call is made. It also tells the database what type conversions to make for the arguments and return value.

Stored procedures offer advantages in the areas of development, integrity, security, performance, and memory allocation.

* [CREATE PACKAGE](CREATE-PACKAGE.md#GUID-40636655-899F-47D0-95CA-D58A71C94A56) for information on creating packages. The `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement creates a procedure as a standalone schema object. You can also create a procedure as part of a package.

Prerequisites

To create or replace a procedure in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. To create or replace a procedure in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege.

To invoke a call spec, you may need additional privileges, for example, the `EXECUTE` object privilege on the C library for a C call spec.

To embed a `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement inside an Oracle precompiler program, you must terminate the statement with the keyword `END-EXEC` followed by the embedded SQL statement terminator for the specific language.

Syntax

Procedures are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, the syntax diagram in this book shows only the SQL keywords. Refer to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01373) for the PL/SQL syntax, semantics, and examples.

OR REPLACE

Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to re-create the procedure if it already exists. Use this clause to change the definition of an existing procedure without dropping, re-creating, and regranting object privileges previously granted on it. If you redefine a procedure, then Oracle Database recompiles it.

Users who had previously been granted privileges on a redefined procedure can still access the procedure without being regranted the privileges.

If any function-based indexes depend on the procedure, then Oracle Database marks the indexes `DISABLED`.

IF NOT EXISTS

Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:

* If the procedure does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
* If the procedure exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.

You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.

You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.

Note:

You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.

[ EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE ]

Use these clauses to specify whether the procedure is an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is enabled for the schema object type `PROCEDURE` in `schema`. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about editioned and noneditioned objects, see [Oracle Database Development Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=ADFNS99923).
