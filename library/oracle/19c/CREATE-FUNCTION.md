# Oracle 19c - CREATE-FUNCTION
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/CREATE-FUNCTION.html

Purpose

Functions are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, this section provides some general information but refers to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01370) for details of syntax and semantics.

Use the `CREATE` `FUNCTION` statement to create a standalone stored function or a call specification.

* A stored function (also called a user function or user-defined function) is a set of PL/SQL statements you can call by name. Stored functions are very similar to procedures, except that a function returns a value to the environment in which it is called. User functions can be used as part of a SQL expression.
* A call specification declares a Java method or a third-generation language (3GL) routine so that it can be called from PL/SQL. You can also use the `CALL` SQL statement to call such a method or routine. The call specification tells Oracle Database which Java method, or which named function in which shared library, to invoke when a call is made. It also tells the database what type conversions to make for the arguments and return value.

Note:

You can also create a function as part of a package using the `CREATE` `PACKAGE` statement.

Prerequisites

To create or replace a function in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. To create or replace a function in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `PROCEDURE` system privilege.

Syntax

Functions are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, the syntax diagram in this book shows only the SQL keywords. Refer to Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference for the PL/SQL syntax, semantics, and examples.

OR REPLACE

Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to re-create the function if it already exists. Use this clause to change the definition of an existing function without dropping, re-creating, and regranting object privileges previously granted on the function. If you redefine a function, then Oracle Database recompiles it.

Users who had previously been granted privileges on a redefined function can still access the function without being regranted the privileges.

If any function-based indexes depend on the function, then Oracle Database marks the indexes `DISABLED`.

See Also:

[`ALTER` `FUNCTION`](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=SQLRF00804) for information on recompiling functions using SQL

[ EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE ]

Use these clauses to specify whether the function is an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is enabled for the schema object type `FUNCTION` in `schema`. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about editioned and noneditioned objects, see [Oracle Database Development Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=ADFNS99923).

IF NOT EXISTS

Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:

* If the function does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
* If the function exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.

You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.

You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.

Note:

You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.
