# Oracle 19c - CREATE-LIBRARY
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/CREATE-LIBRARY.html

Purpose

Use the `CREATE` `LIBRARY` statement to create a schema object associated with an operating-system shared library. The name of this schema object can then be used in the `call_spec` of `CREATE` `FUNCTION` or `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statements, or when declaring a function or procedure in a package or type, so that SQL and PL/SQL can call to third-generation-language (3GL) functions and procedures.

Prerequisites

The `CREATE` `LIBRARY` statement is valid only on platforms that support shared libraries and dynamic linking.

To create a library in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `LIBRARY` system privilege. To create a library in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `LIBRARY` system privilege.

To use the library in the `call_spec` of a `CREATE` `FUNCTION` statement, or when declaring a function in a package or type, you must have the `EXECUTE` object privilege on the library and the `CREATE` `FUNCTION` system privilege. Refer to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01370) for information on the `call_spec` of a `CREATE` `FUNCTION` statement.

To use the library in the `call_spec` of a `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement, or when declaring a procedure in a package or type, you must have the `EXECUTE` object privilege on the library and the `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` system privilege. Refer to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01373) for information on the `call_spec` of a `CREATE` `PROCEDURE` statement.

To execute a procedure or function defined with the `call_spec` (including a procedure or function defined within a package or type), you must have the `EXECUTE` object privilege on the procedure or function (but you do not need the `EXECUTE` object privilege on the library).

Syntax

Libraries are defined using PL/SQL. Therefore, the syntax diagram in this book shows only the SQL keywords. Refer to [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=LNPLS99948) for the PL/SQL syntax, semantics, and examples.

OR REPLACE

Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to re-create the library if it already exists. Use this clause to change the definition of an existing library without dropping, re-creating, and regranting object privileges granted on it.

Users who had previously been granted privileges on a redefined library can still access the library without being regranted the privileges.

IF NOT EXISTS

Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:

* If the library does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
* If the library view exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.

You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.

You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.

Note:

You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.

[ EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE ]

Use these clauses to specify whether the library is an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is enabled for the schema object type `LIBRARY` in `schema`. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about editioned and noneditioned objects, see [Oracle Database Development Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=ADFNS99923).
