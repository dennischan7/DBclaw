# Oracle 19c - annotations_clause
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/annotations_clause.html

Purpose

Annotations provide a mechanism to store application metadata centrally in the database, so that they can be shared across applications, modules and microservices.

You can add annotations to any supported schema objects that you own at creation time via `CREATE` statements.

On supported schema objects that you have alter privileges on, you can add and drop annotations via `ALTER` statements. You do not need to qualify the annotation name with the schema name. Whenever a schema object drops an annotation, or when a schema object is dropped altogether, the usage of the annotation is updated to reflect the drop.

An individual annotation has a name and an optional value. Both the name and the value are freeform text fields. Annotations are additive, meaning that multiple annotations can be specified for the same schema object in a single DDL.

When an annotation name is specified for a schema object for the first time, an annotation is automatically created. Supported schema objects include tables, views, materialized views, and indexes. The annotation is represented as a subordinate element to the database object to which it has been added. Whenever a schema object drops an annotation, or when a schema object is dropped altogether, the usage of the annotation is updated to reflect the drop.

Dictionary views track the list of annotations and their usage across all schema objects. You can query dictionary views `USER|ALL|DBA_ANNOTATIONS_USAGE` to list the annotations for a schema object.

Prerequisites

You must own the schema object or have `ALTER` privileges on the schema object in order to specify annotations on the object.

Note:

You can only use the `annotations_clause` from Release 19.28 and up.

annotations\_clause

Specify `ADD`, `DROP`, or `REPLACE` to create, remove, or change annotations respectively.

* `ADD` creates `annotation_name`. This is the default when no keyword is specified before annotation. If the object already has an annotation with this name, the statement raises an error.

  Use `ADD IF NOT EXISTS` to allow the statement to complete without error. If `annotation_name` is already present, it keeps its original value when using the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause.

  `ADD [IF NOT EXISTS]` is the only valid option to use with `CREATE` statements.
* `DROP` removes `annotation_name` from the object. If the object has no annotation with this name, the statement raises an error. Use `DROP IF EXISTS` to allow the statement to complete without error. This clause is only valid in `ALTER` statements.
* `REPLACE` changes `annotation_value` for `annotation_name` to the supplied value. If you omit the value, this removes any existing value for `annotation_name`. If `annotation_name` does not exist the statement will raise an error. This clause is only valid in `ALTER` statements.

The `annotation_name` is an identifier that can have up to 1024 characters. If the annotation name is a reserved word it must be provided in double quotes. When a double quoted identifier is used, the identifier can also contain whitespace characters. However, identifiers that contain only whitespace characters are not accepted.

An annotation is either a name-value pair or a name by itself. The name and the optional value are freeform text fields. Value can have a maximum of 4000 characters. An annotation `Display_Label, âEmployee Salaryâ` has a name and a value, whereas an annotation `UI_Hidden` has only a name and it does not need a value. `UI_Hidden` is a standalone annotation used to specify that the column should be hidden.

Add Annotations to a Table

The following example adds two operations with values `Sort` and `Group`, and a standalone `Hidden` without a value, to table `t1`:

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (T NUMBER) ANNOTATIONS(Operations '["Sort", "Group"]', Hidden);
```

The annotation can be preceded by the keyword `ADD` which is the default operation if nothing is specified as the following example shows:

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (T NUMBER) ANNOTATIONS (ADD Hidden);
```

Alter Annotations at the Table Level

The following example drops all annotations from `t1`:

```
ALTER TABLE t1 ANNOTATIONS(DROP Operations, DROP Hidden);
```

Add Annotations to Table Columns

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (T NUMBER ANNOTATIONS(Operations 'Sort' , Hidden) );
```

Add Annotations to Table and Columns

```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id NUMBER(5)
    ANNOTATIONS(Identity, Display 'Employee ID', "Group" 'Emp_Info'),
  ename VARCHAR2(50)
    ANNOTATIONS(Display 'Employee Name', "Group" 'Emp_Info'),
  sal NUMBER
    ANNOTATIONS(Display 'Employee Salary', UI_Hidden)
) ANNOTATIONS (Display 'Employee Table');
```

Alter Annotations at the Column Level

```
ALTER TABLE employee
  MODIFY ename ANNOTATIONS (
    DROP "Group",
    DROP IF EXISTS missing_annotation,
    REPLACE Display 'Emp name'
  );
```
