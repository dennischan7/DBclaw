# Oracle 19c - ALTER-SEQUENCE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-SEQUENCE.html

Purpose

Use the `ALTER` `SEQUENCE` statement to change the increment, minimum and maximum values, cached numbers, and behavior of an existing sequence. This statement affects only future sequence numbers.

Prerequisites

The sequence must be in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER` object privilege on the sequence, or you must have the `ALTER` `ANY` `SEQUENCE` system privilege.

IF EXISTS

Specify `IF EXISTS` to alter an existing sequence.

Note:

You can only use `IF EXISTS` from Release 19.28 and up.

The keywords and parameters in this statement serve the same purposes they serve when you create a sequence.

* If you change the `INCREMENT` `BY` value before the first invocation of `NEXTVAL`, then some sequence numbers will be skipped. Therefore, if you want to retain the original `START` `WITH` value, you must drop the sequence and re-create it with the original `START` `WITH` value and the new `INCREMENT` `BY` value.
* Specify `RESTART` to reset `NEXTVAL` to `MINVALUE` for an ascending sequence. For a descending sequence `RESTART` resets `NEXTVAL` to `MAXVALUE`.
* To restart the sequence at a different number, specify `RESTART` with the `START` `WITH` clause to set the value at which the sequence restarts.
* If you alter the sequence by specifying the `KEEP` or `NOKEEP` clause between runtime and failover of a request, then the original value of `NEXTVAL` is not retained during replay for Application Continuity for that request.
* Oracle Database performs some validations. For example, a new `MAXVALUE` cannot be imposed that is less than the current sequence number.

SCALE

Use `SCALE` to enable sequence scalability. When `SCALE` is specified, a numeric offset is affixed to the beginning of the sequence which removes all duplicates in generated values.

EXTEND

If you specify `EXTEND` with `SCALE` the generated sequence values are all of length `(x+y)`, where `x` is the length of the scalable offset (default value is 6), and `y` is the maximum number of digits in the sequence `(maxvalue/minvalue)`.

When you use `SCALE` it is highly recommended that you not use `ORDER` simultaneously on the sequence.

NOEXTEND

`NOEXTEND` is the default setting for the `SCALE` clause. With the `NOEXTEND` setting, the generated sequence values are at most as wide as the maximum number of digits in the sequence `(maxvalue/minvalue)`. This setting is useful for integration with existing applications where sequences are used to populate fixed width columns.

SHARD

Use this clause to generate unique sequence numbers across shards.

The sequence object is created as a global, all-shards sharded object that returns unique sequence values across all shards. The sequence object is also created at the catalog database that returns unique sequence values relative to the shard databases.

The `EXTEND` and `NOEXTEND` keywords define the behavior of a sharded sequence.

EXTEND

When you specify `EXTEND` with the `SHARD` clause, the generated sequence values are all of length `(x + y)`, where `x` is the length of an(a) `SHARD` offset of size 4. The size 4 corresponds to the width of the maximum number of shards i.e. 1000 affixed at the beginning of the sequence values. `y` is the maximum number of digits in the sequence `maxvalue/minvalue`.

NOEXTEND

The default setting for the `SHARD` clause is `NOEXTEND`.

When you specify `NOEXTEND`, the generated sequence values are at most as wide as the maximum number of digits in the sequence `maxvalue/minvalue`. This setting is useful for integration with existing applications where sequences are used to populate fixed width columns.

If you call `NEXTVAL` on a sequence with `SHARD` `NOEXTEND` specified, a user error is thrown, if the generated value requires more digits of representation than the `maxvalue/minvalue` of the sequence.

Sequence with SHARD and SCALE

If you specify the `SCALE` and the `SHARD` clauses together, the sequence generates scalable, globally unique values within a shard database for multiple instances and sessions.

If you specify `EXTEND` with the `SCALE` and `SHARD` clauses, the generated sequence values are all of length `(x+y+z)`, where `x` is the length of a `SHARD` offset with a default value of size 4, `y` is the length of the scalable offset with a default value of 6(5), and `z` is the maximum number of digits in the sequence `maxvalue/minvalue` .

If you specify `EXTEND` or `NOEXTEND` with the `SHARD` and `SCALE` clauses, it applies to both `SHARD` and `SCALE`. You do not need to specify `EXTEND` or `NOEXTEND` separately. If you specify the `EXTEND` or `NOEXTEND` option separately for both the `SHARD` and `SCALE` clauses, with the same or different value, a parsing error results, with a message of a duplicate or conflicting `EXTEND` clause.

When you use `SHARD` it is highly recommended that you not use `ORDER` simultaneously on the sequence.

You can use `SHARD` with `CACHE` and `NOCACHE` modes of operation.

Examples

Modifying a Sequence: Examples

This statement sets a new maximum value for the `customers_seq` sequence, which was created in "[Creating a Sequence: Example](CREATE-SEQUENCE.md#GUID-E9C78A8C-615A-4757-B2A8-5E6EFB130571__I2092099)":

```
ALTER SEQUENCE customers_seq 
   MAXVALUE 1500;
```

This statement turns on `CYCLE` and `CACHE` for the `customers_seq` sequence:

```
ALTER SEQUENCE customers_seq 
   CYCLE
   CACHE 5;
```
