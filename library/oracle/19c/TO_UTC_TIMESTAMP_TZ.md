# Oracle 19c - TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP_TZ
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP_TZ.html

Purpose

The SQL function `TO_UTC_TIMESTAMP_TZ` takes an ISO 8601 date format string as the `varchar` input and returns an instance of SQL data type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`. It normalizes the input to UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time, formerly Greenwich Mean Time). Unlike SQL function `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ` , the new function assumes that the input string uses the ISO 8601 date format, defaulting the time zone to UTC 0.

A typical use of this function would be to provide its output to SQL function `SYS_EXTRACT_UTC`, obtaining a UTC time that is then passed as a SQL bind variable to SQL/JSON condition `JSON_EXISTS`, to perform a time-stamp range comparison.

This is the allowed syntax for dates and times:

where:

* `YYYY` specifies the year, as four decimal digits.
* `MM` specifies the month, as two decimal digits, `00` to `12`.
* `DD` specifies the day, as two decimal digits, `00` to `31`.
* `hh` specifies the hour, as two decimal digits, `00` to `23`.
* `mm` specifies the minutes, as two decimal digits, `00` to `59`.
* `ss[.s[s[s[s[s]]]]]` specifies the seconds, as two decimal digits, `00` to `59`, optionally followed by a decimal point and 1 to 6 decimal digits (representing the fractional part of a second).
* `Z` specifies UTC time (time zone 0). (It can also be specified by `+00:00`, but not by `–00:00`.)
* `(+|-)hh:mm` specifies the time-zone as difference from UTC. (One of `+` or `–` is required.)

For a time value, the time-zone part is optional. If it is absent then UTC time is assumed.

No other ISO 8601 date-time syntax is supported. In particular:

* Negative dates (dates prior to year 1 BCE), which begin with a hyphen (e.g. `–2018–10–26T21:32:52`), are not supported.
* Hyphen and colon separators are required: so-called âbasicâ format, `YYYYMMDDThhmmss`, is not supported.
* Ordinal dates (year plus day of year, calendar week plus day number) are not supported.
* Using more than four digits for the year is not supported.

Supported dates and times include the following:

* `2018–10–26T21:32:52`
* `2018-10-26T21:32:52+02:00`
* `2018-10-26T19:32:52Z`
* `2018-10-26T19:32:52+00:00`
* `2018-10-26T21:32:52.12679`

Unsupported dates and times include the following:

* `2018-10-26T21:32` (if a time is specified then all of its parts must be present)
* `2018-10-26T25:32:52+02:00` (the hours part, 25, is out of range)
* `18-10-26T21:32` (the year is not specified fully)
