# Oracle 19c - About-SQL-Expressions

An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluates to a value. An expression generally assumes the data type of its components.

This simple expression evaluates to 4 and has data type `NUMBER` (the same data type as its components):

```
2*2
```

The following expression is an example of a more complex expression that uses both functions and operators. The expression adds seven days to the current date, removes the time component from the sum, and converts the result to `CHAR` data type:

```
TO_CHAR(TRUNC(SYSDATE+7))
```

You can use expressions in:

* The select list of the `SELECT` statement
* A condition of the `WHERE` clause and `HAVING` clause
* The `CONNECT` `BY`, `START` `WITH`, and `ORDER` `BY` clauses
* The `VALUES` clause of the `INSERT` statement
* The `SET` clause of the `UPDATE` statement

For example, you could use an expression in place of the quoted string `'Smith'` in this `UPDATE` statement `SET` clause:

```
SET last_name = 'Smith';
```

This `SET` clause has the expression `INITCAP`(`last_name`) instead of the quoted string '`Smith`':

```
SET last_name = INITCAP(last_name);
```

Expressions have several forms, as shown in the following syntax:

Oracle Database does not accept all forms of expressions in all parts of all SQL statements. Refer to the section devoted to a particular SQL statement in this book for information on restrictions on the expressions in that statement.

You must use appropriate expression notation whenever `expr` appears in conditions, SQL functions, or SQL statements in other parts of this reference. The sections that follow describe and provide examples of the various forms of expressions.
