# Oracle 19c - FLASHBACK-DATABASE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/FLASHBACK-DATABASE.html

Purpose

Use the `FLASHBACK` `DATABASE` statement to return the database to a past time or system change number (SCN). This statement provides a fast alternative to performing incomplete database recovery.

Following a `FLASHBACK` `DATABASE` operation, in order to have write access to the flashed back database, you must reopen it with an `ALTER` `DATABASE` `OPEN` `RESETLOGS` statement.

Prerequisites

You must have the `SYSDBA`, `SYSBACKUP`, or `SYSDG` system privilege.

If you are connected to a multitenant container database (CDB):

* To flash back a CDB, you must be connected to the root and you must have the `SYSDBA`, `SYSBACKUP`, or `SYSDG` system privilege granted commonly.
* To flash back a PDB you must be connected to the root and you must have the `SYSDBA`, `SYSBACKUP`, or `SYSDG` system privilege granted commonly, or you must be connected to the PDB you want to flash back and you must have the `SYSDBA`, `SYSBACKUP`, or `SYSDG` system privilege, granted commonly or granted locally in that PDB.

A fast recovery area must have been prepared for the database. The database must have been put in `FLASHBACK` mode with an `ALTER` `DATABASE` `FLASHBACK` `ON` statement unless you are flashing the database back to a guaranteed restore point. The database must be mounted but not open.

In addition:

* The database must run in `ARCHIVELOG` mode.
* The database must be mounted, but not open, with a current control file. The control file cannot be a backup or re-created. When the database control file is restored from backup or re-created, all existing flashback log information is discarded.
* The database must contain no online tablespaces for which flashback functionality was disabled with the SQL statement `ALTER` `TABLESPACE` ... `FLASHBACK` `OFF`.

Semantics

When you issue a `FLASHBACK` `DATABASE` statement, Oracle Database first verifies that all required archived and online redo logs are available. If they are available, then it reverts all currently online data files in the database to the SCN or time specified in this statement.

* The amount of Flashback data retained in the database is controlled by the `DB_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET` initialization parameter and the size of the fast recovery area. You can determine how far back you can flash back the database by querying the `V$FLASHBACK_DATABASE_LOG` view.
* If insufficient data remains in the database to perform the flashback, then you can use standard recovery procedures to recover the database to a past point in time.
* If insufficient data remains for a set of data files, then the database returns an error. In this case, you can take those data files offline and reissue the statement to revert the remainder of the database. You can then attempt to recover the offline data files using standard recovery procedures.

STANDBY

Specify `STANDBY` to revert the standby database to an earlier SCN or time. If the database is not a standby database, then the database returns an error. If you omit this clause, then `database` can be either a primary or a standby database.

PLUGGABLE

Specify `PLUGGABLE` to flash back a PDB. You must specify this clause whether the current container is the root or the PDB you want to flash back.

Restrictions on Flashing Back a PDB

* You cannot flash back a proxy PDB.
* If the CDB is in shared undo mode, then you can only flash back a PDB to a clean PDB restore point. Refer to the [CLEAN](CREATE-RESTORE-POINT.md#GUID-AD0FB693-7C28-4908-A870-BA884B320575__CLEAN-2B81B840) clause of `CREATE` `RESTORE` `POINT` for more information.

database

If you are flashing back a non-CDB or a CDB, then you can optionally specify the name of the database to be flashed back. If you omit `database`, then Oracle Database flashes back the database identified by the value of the initialization parameter `DB_NAME`.

If you are flashing back a PDB and the current container is the root, then use `database` to specify the name of the PDB to be flashed back. If you are flashing back a PDB and the current container is that PDB, then you can optionally use `database` to specify the PDB name.

TO SCN Clause

Specify a system change number (SCN):

You can determine the current SCN by querying the `CURRENT_SCN` column of the [`V$DATABASE`](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf&id=REFRN30047) view. This in turn lets you save the SCN to a spool file, for example, before running a high-risk batch job.

TO TIMESTAMP Clause

Specify a valid datetime expression.

You can represent the timestamp as an offset from a determinate value, such as `SYSDATE`, or as an absolute system timestamp.

TO RESTORE POINT Clause

Specify this clause to flash back the database to the specified restore point. If you have not enabled flashback database, then this is the only clause you can specify in this `FLASHBACK` `DATABASE` statement. If the database is not in `FLASHBACK` mode, as described in the "Prerequisites" section above, then this is the only clause you can specify for this statement.

RESETLOGS

Specify `TO` `BEFORE` `RESETLOGS` to flash the database back to just before the last resetlogs operation (`ALTER` `DATABASE` `OPEN` `RESETLOGS`).

Examples

Assuming that you have prepared a fast recovery area for the database and enabled media recovery, enable database `FLASHBACK` mode and open the database with the following statements:

```
STARTUP MOUNT 
ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK ON;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
```

With your database open for at least a day, you can flash back the database one day with the following statements:

```
SHUTDOWN DATABASE
STARTUP MOUNT 
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO TIMESTAMP SYSDATE-1;
```
