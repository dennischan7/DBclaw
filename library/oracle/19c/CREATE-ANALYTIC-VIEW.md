# Oracle 19c - CREATE-ANALYTIC-VIEW
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/CREATE-ANALYTIC-VIEW.html

Purpose

Use the `CREATE` `ANALYTIC` `VIEW` statement to create an analytic view. An analytic view specifies the source of its fact data and defines measures that describe calculations or other analytic operations to perform on the data. An analytic view also specifies the attribute dimensions and hierarchies that define the rows of the analytic view.

Prerequisites

To create an analytic view in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANALYTIC` `VIEW` system privilege. To create an analytic view in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `ANALYTIC` `VIEW` system privilege.

default\_measure\_clause::=

default\_aggregate\_clause::=

OR REPLACE

Specify `OR` `REPLACE` to replace an existing definition of an analytic view with a different definition.

FORCE and NOFORCE

Specify `FORCE` to force the creation of the analytic view even if it does not successfully compile. If you specify `NOFORCE`, then the analytic view must compile successfully, otherwise an error occurs. The default is `NOFORCE`.

schema

Specify the schema in which to create the analytic view. If you do not specify a schema, then Oracle Database creates the analytic view in your own schema.

IF NOT EXISTS

Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:

* If the analytic view does not exist, a new one is created at the end of the statement.
* If the analytic view exists, it is detected and a new one is not created.

You can only specify `OR REPLACE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` in a statement at a time. Using both `OR REPLACE` with `IF NOT EXISTS` in the very same statement results in an error.

You cannot specify `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` statements.

Note:

You can use `IF [NOT] EXISTS` only from Release 19.28 and up.

analytic\_view

Specify a name for the analytic view.

SHARING

Use the sharing clause if you want to create the object in an application root in the context of an application maintenance. This type of object is called an application common object and it can be shared with the application PDBs that belong to the application root.

You can specify how the object is shared using one of the following sharing attributes:

* `METADATA` - A metadata link shares the metadata, but its data is unique to each container. This type of object is referred to as a metadata-linked application common object.
* `NONE` - The object is not shared and can only be accessed in the application root.

classification\_clause

Use the classification clause to specify values for the `CAPTION` or `DESCRIPTION` classifications and to specify user-defined classifications. Classifications provide descriptive metadata that applications may use to provide information about analytic views and their components.

You may specify any number of classifications for the same object. A classification can have a maximum length of 4000 bytes.

For the `CAPTION` and `DESCRIPTION` classifications, you may use the DDL shortcuts `CAPTION` `'``caption``'` and `DESCRIPTION` `'``description``'` or the full classification syntax.

You may vary the classification values by language. To specify a language for the `CAPTION` or `DESCRIPTION` classification, you must use the full syntax. If you do not specify a language, then the language value for the classification is `NULL`. The language value must either be `NULL` or a valid `NLS_LANGUAGE` value.

using\_clause

Specify a fact table or view. External and remote tables are permitted. You may specify a table or view in another schema. You can specify an alias for the table or view.

dim\_by\_clause

Specify the attribute dimensions of the analytic view.

dim\_key

Specify an attribute dimension, columns of the fact table, columns of the attribute dimension, and hierarchies that are related in the analytic view.

With the `KEY` keyword, specify one or more columns in the fact table.

With the `REFERENCES` keyword, specify attributes of the attribute dimensions that the analytic view is dimensioned by. Each attribute must be a level key. The `DISTINCT` keyword supports the use of denormalized fact tables, in which the attribute dimension and fact data are in the same table. Use `REFERENCES` `DISTINCT` when an attribute dimension is defined using the fact table.

With the `HIERARCHIES` keyword, specify the hierarchies in the analytic view that use the attribute dimension.

dim\_ref

Specify an attribute dimension. You can specify an alias for an attribute dimension, which is required if you use the same dimension more than once or if you use multiple dimensions with the same name from different schemas.

hier\_ref

Specify a hierarchy. You can specify an alias for a hierarchy. You can specify one of the hierarchies in the list as the default. If you do not specify a default, the first hierarchy in the list is the default.

measures\_clause

Specify the measures for the analytic view.

av\_measure

Define a measure using either a single fact column or an expression over measures in this analytic view. A measure can be either a base measure or a calculated measure.

base\_measure\_clause

Define a base measure by optionally specifying a fact column or a `meas_aggregate_clause`, or both. If you do not specify a fact column, then the analytic view uses the column of the fact table that has the same name as the measure. If a column by the same name does not exist, an error is raised.

calc\_measure\_clause

Define a calculated measure by specifying an analytic view expression. The expression may reference other measures in the analytic view, but may not reference fact columns. Calculated measures do not have an aggregate clause because they're computed over the aggregated base measures.

For the syntax and descriptions of analytic view expressions, see [Analytic View Expressions](analytic-view-measure-expressions.md#GUID-F8C7ED67-A4EC-479C-975F-12F1F4B8CBA0 "You can use analytic view expressions to create calculated measures within the definition of an analytic view or in a query that selects from an analytic view.").

default\_measure\_clause

Specify a measure to use as the default measure for the analytic view. If you do not specify a measure, the first measure defined is the default.

meas\_aggregate\_clausÃ¨

Specify a default aggregation operator for a base measure. If you do not specify an aggregation operator, then the operator specified by the `default_aggregate_clause` is used.

default\_aggregate\_clause

Specify a default aggregation for all base measures in the analytic view. If you do not specify a default aggregation, then the default value is `SUM`.

cache\_clause

Specify a cache clause to improve query response time when an appropriate materialized view is available. You can specify one or more cache specifications.

cache\_specification

Specify one or more measure groups for a cache clause. To include all measure groups, specify `ALL`. Each measure group can contain one or more measures and one or more level groupings. A level grouping can contain one or more level specifications.

level\_specification

Specify one or more levels for a level grouping of a measure group for a cache specification. Specify only one level per hierarchy. A materialized view must exist that contains the aggregated values for the hierarchy level.

Examples

The following is a description of the `SALES_FACT` table:

```
desc SALES_FACT
Name              Null? Type          
----------------- ----- ------------- 
MONTH_ID                VARCHAR2(10)  
CATEGORY_ID             NUMBER(6)     
STATE_PROVINCE_ID       VARCHAR2(120) 
UNITS                   NUMBER(6)     
SALES                   NUMBER(12,2)
```

The following example creates the `SALES_AV` analytic view using the `SALES_FACT` table:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE ANALYTIC VIEW sales_av
USING sales_fact
DIMENSION BY
  (time_attr_dim                         -- An attribute dimension of time data
    KEY month_id REFERENCES month_id
    HIERARCHIES (
      time_hier DEFAULT),
   product_attr_dim                      -- An attribute dimension of product data
    KEY category_id REFERENCES category_id
    HIERARCHIES (
      product_hier DEFAULT),
   geography_attr_dim                    -- An attribute dimension of store data
    KEY state_province_id 
    REFERENCES state_province_id HIERARCHIES (
      geography_hier DEFAULT)
   )
MEASURES
 (sales FACT sales,                      -- A base measure

  chg_sales_qtr_ago AS

     ACROSS ANCESTOR AT LEVEL quarter)),
  pct_chg_sales_qtr_ago AS
    (LAG_DIFF_PERCENT(sales) OVER (HIERARCHY time_hier OFFSET 1
     ACROSS ANCESTOR AT LEVEL quarter))
  )
