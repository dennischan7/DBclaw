# Oracle 19c - APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL.html

Purpose

`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL` calculates information about the approximate number of rows that contain a distinct value for expr and returns a BLOB value, called a detail, which contains that information in a special format.

For `expr`, you can specify a column of any scalar data type other than `BFILE`, `BLOB`, `CLOB`, `LONG`, `LONG` `RAW`, or `NCLOB`. This function ignores rows for which the value of `expr` is null.

This function is commonly used with the `GROUP` `BY` clause in a `SELECT` statement. When used in this way, it calculates approximate distinct value count information for `expr` within each group of rows and returns a single detail for each group.

The details returned by `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL` can be used as input to the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG` function, which enables you to perform aggregations of the details, or the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function, which converts a detail to a human-readable distinct count value. You can use these three functions together to perform resource-intensive approximate count calculations once, store the resulting details, and then perform efficient aggregations and queries on those details. For example:

1. Use the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL` function to calculate approximate distinct value count information and store the resulting details in a table or materialized view. These could be highly-granular details, such as city demographic counts or daily sales counts.
2. Use the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG` function to aggregate the details obtained in the previous step and store the resulting details in a table or materialized view. These could be details of lower granularity, such as state demographic counts or monthly sales counts.
3. Use the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function to convert the stored detail values to human-readable `NUMBER` values. You can use the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function to query detail values created by the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL` function or the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTNCT_AGG` function.

Examples

The examples in this section demonstrate how to use the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL`, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG`, and `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` functions together to perform resource-intensive approximate count calculations once, store the resulting details, and then perform efficient aggregations and queries on those details.

APPROX\_COUNT\_DISTINCT\_DETAIL: Example

The following statement queries the tables `sh`.`times` and `sh`.`sales` for the approximate number of distinct products sold each day. The `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL` function returns the information in a detail, called `daily_detail`, for each day that products were sold. The returned details are stored in a materialized view called `daily_prod_count_mv`.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_prod_count_mv AS
  SELECT t.calendar_year year,
         t.calendar_month_number month,
         t.day_number_in_month day,
         APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DETAIL(s.prod_id) daily_detail
  FROM times t, sales s
  WHERE t.time_id = s.time_id
  GROUP BY t.calendar_year, t.calendar_month_number, t.day_number_in_month;
```

APPROX\_COUNT\_DISTINCT\_AGG: Examples

The following statement uses the `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG` function to read the daily details stored in `daily_prod_count_mv` and create aggregated details that contain the approximate number of distinct products sold each month. These aggregated details are stored in a materialized view called `monthly_prod_count_mv`.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_prod_count_mv AS
  SELECT year,
         month,
         APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG(daily_detail) monthly_detail
  FROM daily_prod_count_mv
  GROUP BY year, month;
```

The following statement is similar to the previous statement, except it creates aggregated details that contain the approximate number of distinct products sold each year. These aggregated details are stored in a materialized view called `annual_prod_count_mv`.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW annual_prod_count_mv AS
  SELECT year,
         APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_AGG(daily_detail) annual_detail
  FROM daily_prod_count_mv
  GROUP BY year;
```

TO\_APPROX\_COUNT\_DISTINCT: Examples

The following statement uses the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function to query the daily detail information stored in `daily_prod_count_mv` and return the approximate number of distinct products sold each day:

```
SELECT year,
       month,
       day,
       TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(daily_detail) "NUM PRODUCTS"
  FROM daily_prod_count_mv
  ORDER BY year, month, day;

      YEAR      MONTH        DAY NUM PRODUCTS

The following statement uses the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function to query the monthly detail information stored in `monthly_prod_count_mv` and return the approximate number of distinct products sold each month:

```
SELECT year,
       month,
       TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(monthly_detail) "NUM PRODUCTS"
  FROM monthly_prod_count_mv
  ORDER BY year, month;

      YEAR      MONTH NUM PRODUCTS

The following statement uses the `TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` function to query the annual detail information stored in `annual_prod_count_mv` and return the approximate number of distinct products sold each year:

SELECT year,
       TO_APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(annual_detail) "NUM PRODUCTS"
  FROM annual_prod_count_mv
  ORDER BY year;
