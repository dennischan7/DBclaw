# Oracle 19c - COALESCE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/COALESCE.html

`COALESCE` returns the first non-null `expr` in the expression list. You must specify at least two expressions. If all occurrences of `expr` evaluate to null, then the function returns null.

Oracle Database uses short-circuit evaluation. The database evaluates each `expr` value and determines whether it is `NULL`, rather than evaluating all of the `expr` values before determining whether any of them is `NULL`.

If all occurrences of `expr` are numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type, then Oracle Database determines the argument with the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the remaining arguments to that data type, and returns that data type.

This function is a generalization of the `NVL` function.

You can also use `COALESCE` as a variety of the `CASE` expression. For example,

```
COALESCE(expr1, expr2)
```

is equivalent to:

```
CASE WHEN expr1 IS NOT NULL THEN expr1 ELSE expr2 END
```

Similarly,

```
COALESCE(expr1, expr2, ..., exprn)
```

where `n` >= 3, is equivalent to:

```
CASE WHEN expr1 IS NOT NULL THEN expr1 
   ELSE COALESCE (expr2, ..., exprn) END
```

The following example uses the sample `oe.product_information` table to organize a clearance sale of products. It gives a 10% discount to all products with a list price. If there is no list price, then the sale price is the minimum price. If there is no minimum price, then the sale price is "5":

```
SELECT product_id, list_price, min_price,
       COALESCE(0.9*list_price, min_price, 5) "Sale"
  FROM product_information
  WHERE supplier_id = 102050
  ORDER BY product_id;

PRODUCT_ID LIST_PRICE  MIN_PRICE       Sale
