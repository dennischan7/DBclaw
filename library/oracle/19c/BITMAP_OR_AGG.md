# Oracle 19c - BITMAP_OR_AGG
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/BITMAP_OR_AGG.html

Purpose

`BITMAP_OR_AGG` is an aggregation function that operates on bitmaps and computes the OR of its inputs.

The argument `expr` must be of type `BLOB`.

The return type is of type `BLOB`. It returns the bitmap representing the OR of all the bitmaps it has aggregated.

The output of `BITMAP_OR_AGG` is not human-readable. It is meant to be processed by further aggregations via `BITMAP_OR_AGG` or by the scalar function `BITMAP_COUNT`.

If `expr` is NULL, the function returns NULL.

Restrictions

The argument must be of type

`BLOB`

type. The argument is expected to be a bitmap produced by

`BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG`

or, recursively, by

`BITMAP_OR_AGG`

.Any other input results in

`ORA-62578`

:

```
62578, 00000, "The input is not a valid bitmap produced by BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operators."
// *Cause: An attempt was made to pass a bitmap that was not produced by one of the BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT operators.
// *Action: Only pass bitmaps constructed via BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG or BITMAP_OR_AGG to BITMAP COUNT DISTINCT related operators.
