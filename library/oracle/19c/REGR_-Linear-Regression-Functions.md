# Oracle 19c - REGR_-Linear-Regression-Functions
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/REGR_-Linear-Regression-Functions.html

The linear regression functions are:

* `REGR_SLOPE`
* `REGR_INTERCEPT`
* `REGR_COUNT`
* `REGR_R2`
* `REGR_AVGX`
* `REGR_AVGY`
* `REGR_SXX`
* `REGR_SYY`
* `REGR_SXY`

The linear regression functions fit an ordinary-least-squares regression line to a set of number pairs. You can use them as both aggregate and analytic functions.

These functions take as arguments any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. Oracle determines the argument with the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the remaining arguments to that data type, and returns that data type.

Oracle applies the function to the set of (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs after eliminating all pairs for which either `expr1` or `expr2` is null. Oracle computes all the regression functions simultaneously during a single pass through the data.

`expr1` is interpreted as a value of the dependent variable (a `y` value), and `expr2` is interpreted as a value of the independent variable (an `x` value).

* `REGR_SLOPE` returns the slope of the line. The return value is a numeric data type and can be null. After the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs, it makes the following computation:

  ```
  COVAR_POP(expr1, expr2) / VAR_POP(expr2)
  ```
* `REGR_INTERCEPT` returns the y-intercept of the regression line. The return value is a numeric data type and can be null. After the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs, it makes the following computation:

  ```
  AVG(expr1) - REGR_SLOPE(expr1, expr2) * AVG(expr2)
  ```
* `REGR_COUNT` returns an integer that is the number of non-null number pairs used to fit the regression line.
* `REGR_R2` returns the coefficient of determination (also called R-squared or goodness of fit) for the regression. The return value is a numeric data type and can be null. `VAR_POP`(`expr1`) and `VAR_POP`(`expr2`) are evaluated after the elimination of null pairs. The return values are:

  ```
                       NULL if VAR_POP(expr2)  = 0

                          1 if VAR_POP(expr1)  = 0 and 
                               VAR_POP(expr2) != 0

  POWER(CORR(expr1,expr),2) if VAR_POP(expr1)  > 0 and
                               VAR_POP(expr2  != 0
  ```

All of the remaining regression functions return a numeric data type and can be null:

* `REGR_AVGX` evaluates the average of the independent variable (`expr2`) of the regression line. It makes the following computation after the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs:

  ```
  AVG(expr2)
  ```
* `REGR_AVGY` evaluates the average of the dependent variable (`expr1`) of the regression line. It makes the following computation after the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs:

  ```
  AVG(expr1)
  ```

`REGR_SXY`, `REGR_SXX`, `REGR_SYY` are auxiliary functions that are used to compute various diagnostic statistics.

* `REGR_SXX` makes the following computation after the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs:

  ```
  REGR_COUNT(expr1, expr2) * VAR_POP(expr2)
  ```
* `REGR_SYY` makes the following computation after the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs:

  ```
  REGR_COUNT(expr1, expr2) * VAR_POP(expr1)
  ```
* `REGR_SXY` makes the following computation after the elimination of null (`expr1`, `expr2`) pairs:

  ```
  REGR_COUNT(expr1, expr2) * COVAR_POP(expr1, expr2)
  ```

The following examples are based on the sample tables `sh.sales` and `sh.products`.

General Linear Regression Example

The following example provides a comparison of the various linear regression functions used in their analytic form. The analytic form of these functions can be useful when you want to use regression statistics for calculations such as finding the salary predicted for each employee by the model. The sections that follow on the individual linear regression functions contain examples of the aggregate form of these functions.
