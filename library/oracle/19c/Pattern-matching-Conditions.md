# Oracle 19c - Pattern-matching-Conditions
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Pattern-matching-Conditions.html

The `LIKE` conditions specify a test involving pattern matching. Whereas the equality operator (=) exactly matches one character value to another, the `LIKE` conditions match a portion of one character value to another by searching the first value for the pattern specified by the second. `LIKE` calculates strings using characters as defined by the input character set. `LIKEC` uses Unicode complete characters. `LIKE2` uses UCS2 code points. `LIKE4` uses UCS4 code points.

In this syntax:

* `char1` is a character expression, such as a character column, called the search value.
* `char2` is a character expression, usually a literal, called the pattern.
* `esc_char` is a character expression, usually a literal, called the escape character.

The `LIKE` condition is the best choice in almost all situations. Use the following guidelines to determine whether any of the variations would be helpful in your environment:

* Use `LIKE2` to process strings using UCS-2 semantics. `LIKE2` treats a Unicode supplementary character as two characters.
* Use `LIKE4` to process strings using UCS-4 semantics. `LIKE4` treats a Unicode supplementary character as one character.
* Use `LIKEC` to process strings using Unicode complete character semantics. `LIKEC` treats a composite character as one character.

For more on character length see the following:

If `esc_char` is not specified, then there is no default escape character. If any of `char1`, `char2`, or `esc_char` is null, then the result is unknown. Otherwise, the escape character, if specified, must be a character string of length 1.

All of the character expressions (`char1`, `char2`, and `esc_char`) can be of any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. If they differ, then Oracle converts all of them to the data type of `char1`.

The pattern can contain special pattern-matching characters:

* An underscore (\_) in the pattern matches exactly one character (as opposed to one byte in a multibyte character set) in the value.
* A percent sign (%) in the pattern can match zero or more characters (as opposed to bytes in a multibyte character set) in the value. The pattern '%' cannot match a null.

You can include the actual characters `%` or `_` in the pattern by using the `ESCAPE` clause, which identifies the escape character. If the escape character precedes the character `%` or `_` in the pattern, then Oracle interprets this character literally in the pattern rather than as a special pattern-matching character. You can also search for the escape character itself by repeating it. For example, if @ is the escape character, then you can use @@ to search for @.

Note:

Only ASCII-equivalent underscore (\_) and percent (%) characters are recognized as pattern-matching characters. Their full-width variants, present in East Asian character sets and in Unicode, are treated as normal characters.

[Table 6-8](Pattern-matching-Conditions.md#GUID-0779657B-06A8-441F-90C5-044B47862A0A__CJADEBJE "The first column lists the LIKE conditions, the second column describes their operation, and the third provides an example.") describes the `LIKE` conditions.

Table 6-8 LIKE Condition

| Type of Condition | Operation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``` x [NOT] LIKE y  [ESCAPE 'z'] ``` | `TRUE` if `x` does [not] match the pattern `y`. Within `y`, the character `%` matches any string of zero or more characters except null. The character `_` matches any single character. Any character can follow `ESCAPE` except percent (%) and underbar (\_). A wildcard character is treated as a literal if preceded by the escape character. | ``` SELECT last_name     FROM employees    WHERE last_name     LIKE '%A\_B%' ESCAPE '\'    ORDER BY last_name; ``` |

To process the `LIKE` conditions, Oracle divides the pattern into subpatterns consisting of one or two characters each. The two-character subpatterns begin with the escape character and the other character is %, or \_, or the escape character.

Let P1, P2, ..., Pn be these subpatterns. The like condition is true if there is a way to partition the search value into substrings S1, S2, ..., Sn so that for all i between 1 and n:

* If Pi is \_, then Si is a single character.
* If Pi is %, then Si is any string.
* If Pi is two characters beginning with an escape character, then Si is the second character of Pi.
* Otherwise, Pi = Si.

With the `LIKE` conditions, you can compare a value to a pattern rather than to a constant. The pattern must appear after the `LIKE` keyword. For example, you can issue the following query to find the salaries of all employees with names beginning with `R`:

```
SELECT salary 
    FROM employees
    WHERE last_name LIKE 'R%'
    ORDER BY salary;
```

The following query uses the = operator, rather than the `LIKE` condition, to find the salaries of all employees with the name 'R%':

```
SELECT salary 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE last_name = 'R%'
    ORDER BY salary;
```

The following query finds the salaries of all employees with the name 'SM%'. Oracle interprets 'SM%' as a text literal, rather than as a pattern, because it precedes the `LIKE` keyword:

```
SELECT salary 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE 'SM%' LIKE last_name
    ORDER BY salary;
```

Collation and Case Sensitivity

The `LIKE` condition is collation-sensitive. Oracle Database compares the subpattern Pi to the substring Si in the processing algorithm above using the collation determined from the derived collations of `char1` and `char2`. If this collation is case-insensitive, the pattern-matching is case-insensitive as well.

Pattern Matching on Indexed Columns

When you use `LIKE` to search an indexed column for a pattern, Oracle can use the index to improve performance of a query if the leading character in the pattern is not `%` or `_`. In this case, Oracle can scan the index by this leading character. If the first character in the pattern is `%` or `_`, then the index cannot improve performance because Oracle cannot scan the index.

LIKE Condition: General Examples

This condition is true for all `last_name` values beginning with `Ma`:

```
last_name LIKE 'Ma%'
```

All of these `last_name` values make the condition true:

```
Mallin, Markle, Marlow, Marvins, Mavris, Matos
```

Case is significant, so `last_name` values beginning with `MA`, `ma`, and `mA` make the condition false.

Consider this condition:

```
last_name LIKE 'SMITH_'
```

This condition is true for these `last_name` values:

```
SMITHE, SMITHY, SMITHS
```

This condition is false for `SMITH` because the special underscore character (`_`) must match exactly one character of the `last_name` value.

The following example searches for employees with the pattern `A_B` in their name:

```
SELECT last_name 
    FROM employees
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%A\_B%' ESCAPE '\'
    ORDER BY last_name;
```

The `ESCAPE` clause identifies the backslash (\) as the escape character. In the pattern, the escape character precedes the underscore (\_). This causes Oracle to interpret the underscore literally, rather than as a special pattern matching character.

Patterns Without % Example

If a pattern does not contain the `%` character, then the condition can be true only if both operands have the same length. Consider the definition of this table and the values inserted into it:

```
CREATE TABLE ducks (f CHAR(6), v VARCHAR2(6));
INSERT INTO ducks VALUES ('DUCK', 'DUCK');
SELECT '*'||f||'*' "char",
   '*'||v||'*' "varchar"
   FROM ducks;

char     varchar
-------- --------
*DUCK  * *DUCK*
```

Because Oracle blank-pads `CHAR` values, the value of `f` is blank-padded to 6 bytes. `v` is not blank-padded and has length 4.
