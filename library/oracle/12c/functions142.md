Syntax

clause

Purpose

`PERCENTILE_DISC` is an inverse distribution function that assumes a discrete distribution model. It takes a percentile value and a sort specification and returns an element from the set. Nulls are ignored in the calculation.

This function takes as an argument any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of the argument.

The first `expr` must evaluate to a numeric value between 0 and 1, because it is a percentile value. This expression must be constant within each aggregate group. The `ORDER` `BY` clause takes a single expression that can be of any type that can be sorted.

For a given percentile value `P`, `PERCENTILE_DISC` sorts the values of the expression in the `ORDER` `BY` clause and returns the value with the smallest `CUME_DIST` value (with respect to the same sort specification) that is greater than or equal to `P`.

Aggregate Example

See aggregate example for [PERCENTILE\_CONT](functions141.md#i1000909).

Analytic Example

The following example calculates the median discrete percentile of the salary of each employee in the sample table `hr.employees`:

```
SELECT last_name, salary, department_id,
       PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary DESC)
         OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) "Percentile_Disc",
       CUME_DIST() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id 
         ORDER BY salary DESC) "Cume_Dist"
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id in (30, 60)
  ORDER BY last_name, salary, department_id;

LAST_NAME                     SALARY DEPARTMENT_ID Percentile_Disc  Cume_Dist

```

The median value for Department 30 is 2900, which is the value whose corresponding percentile (`Cume_Dist`) is the smallest value greater than or equal to 0.5. The median value for Department 60 is 4800, which is the value whose corresponding percentile is the smallest value greater than or equal to 0.5.
