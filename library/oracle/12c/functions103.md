# LNNVL

Syntax

Purpose

`LNNVL` provides a concise way to evaluate a condition when one or both operands of the condition may be null. The function can be used in the `WHERE` clause of a query, or as the `WHEN` condition in a searched `CASE` expression. It takes as an argument a condition and returns `TRUE` if the condition is `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN` and `FALSE` if the condition is `TRUE`. `LNNVL` can be used anywhere a scalar expression can appear, even in contexts where the `IS` [`NOT`] `NULL`, `AND`, or `OR` conditions are not valid but would otherwise be required to account for potential nulls.

Oracle Database sometimes uses the `LNNVL` function internally in this way to rewrite `NOT` `IN` conditions as `NOT` `EXISTS` conditions. In such cases, output from `EXPLAIN` `PLAN` shows this operation in the plan table output. The `condition` can evaluate any scalar values but cannot be a compound condition containing `AND`, `OR`, or `BETWEEN`.

The table that follows shows what `LNNVL` returns given that `a` = 2 and `b` is null.

| Condition | Truth of Condition | LNNVL Return Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a = 1 | `FALSE` | `TRUE` |
| a = 2 | `TRUE` | `FALSE` |
| a `IS` `NULL` | `FALSE` | `TRUE` |
| b = 1 | `UNKNOWN` | `TRUE` |
| b `IS` `NULL` | `TRUE` | `FALSE` |
| a = b | `UNKNOWN` | `TRUE` |

Examples

Suppose that you want to know the number of employees with commission rates of less than 20%, including employees who do not receive commissions. The following query returns only employees who actually receive a commission of less than 20%:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM employees
  WHERE commission_pct < .2;

  COUNT(*)
----------
        11
```

To include the 72 employees who receive no commission at all, you could rewrite the query using the `LNNVL` function as follows:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM employees
  WHERE LNNVL(commission_pct >= .2);

  COUNT(*)
----------
        83
```
