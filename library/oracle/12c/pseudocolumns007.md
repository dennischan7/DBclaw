# ORA\_ROWSCN Pseudocolumn

`ORA_ROWSCN` reflects the system change-number (SCN) of the most recent change to a row. This change can be at the level of a block (coarse) or at the level of a row (fine-grained). The latter is provided by row-level dependency tracking. Refer to `CREATE` `TABLE` ... [NOROWDEPENDENCIES | ROWDEPENDENCIES](statements_7002.md#CJAEEGDA) for more information on row-level dependency tracking. In the absence of row-level dependencies, `ORA_ROWSCN` reflects block-level dependencies.

Whether at the block level or at the row level, the `ORA_ROWSCN` should not be considered to be an exact SCN. For example, if a transaction changed row R in a block and committed at SCN 10, it is not always true that the `ORA_ROWSCN` for the row would return 10. While a value less than 10 would never be returned, any value greater than or equal to 10 could be returned. That is, the `ORA_ROWSCN` of a row is not always guaranteed to be the exact commit SCN of the transaction that last modified that row. However, with fine-grained `ORA_ROWSCN`, if two transactions T1 and T2 modified the same row R, one after another, and committed, a query on the `ORA_ROWSCN` of row R after the commit of T1 will return a value lower than the value returned after the commit of T2. If a block is queried twice, then it is possible for the value of `ORA_ROWSCN` to change between the queries even though rows have not been updated in the time between the queries. The only guarantee is that the value of `ORA_ROWSCN` in both queries is greater than the commit SCN of the transaction that last modified that row.

You cannot use the `ORA_ROWSCN` pseudocolumn in a query to a view. However, you can use it to refer to the underlying table when creating a view. You can also use this pseudocolumn in the `WHERE` clause of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.

`ORA_ROWSCN` is not supported for Flashback Query. Instead, use the version query pseudocolumns, which are provided explicitly for Flashback Query. Refer to the `SELECT` ... [flashback\_query\_clause](statements_10002.md#i2112818) for information on Flashback Query and ["Version Query Pseudocolumns"](pseudocolumns003.md#i1009358) for additional information on those pseudocolumns.

Restriction on ORA\_ROWSCN: This pseudocolumn is not supported for external tables.

Example The first statement below uses the `ORA_ROWSCN` pseudocolumn to get the system change number of the last operation on the `employees` table. The second statement uses the pseudocolumn with the `SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP` function to determine the timestamp of the operation:

```
SELECT ORA_ROWSCN, last_name
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = 188;

SELECT SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP(ORA_ROWSCN), last_name
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = 188;
```
