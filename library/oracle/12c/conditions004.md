# Logical Conditions

A logical condition combines the results of two component conditions to produce a single result based on them or to invert the result of a single condition. [Table 6-4](#BABDGHHB) lists logical conditions.

Table 6-4 Logical Conditions

| Type of Condition | Operation | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``` NOT ``` | Returns `TRUE` if the following condition is `FALSE`. Returns `FALSE` if it is `TRUE`. If it is `UNKNOWN`, then it remains `UNKNOWN`. | ``` SELECT *   FROM employees   WHERE NOT (job_id IS NULL)   ORDER BY employee_id; SELECT *   FROM employees   WHERE NOT    (salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000)   ORDER BY employee_id; ``` |
| ``` AND ``` | Returns `TRUE` if both component conditions are `TRUE`. Returns `FALSE` if either is `FALSE`. Otherwise returns `UNKNOWN`. | ``` SELECT *   FROM employees   WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK'   AND department_id = 30   ORDER BY employee_id; ``` |
| ``` OR ``` | Returns `TRUE` if either component condition is `TRUE`. Returns `FALSE` if both are `FALSE`. Otherwise returns `UNKNOWN`. | ``` SELECT *   FROM employees   WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK'   OR department_id = 10   ORDER BY employee_id; ``` |

[Table 6-5](#g1068986) shows the result of applying the `NOT` condition to an expression.

Table 6-5 NOT Truth Table

| -- | TRUE | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NOT | `FALSE` | `TRUE` | `UNKNOWN` |

[Table 6-6](#g1068810) shows the results of combining the `AND` condition to two expressions.

Table 6-6 AND Truth Table

| AND | TRUE | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TRUE | `TRUE` | `FALSE` | `UNKNOWN` |
| FALSE | `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE` |
| UNKNOWN | `UNKNOWN` | `FALSE` | `UNKNOWN` |

For example, in the `WHERE` clause of the following `SELECT` statement, the `AND` logical condition is used to ensure that only those hired before 2004 and earning more than $2500 a month are returned:

```
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < TO_DATE('01-JAN-2004', 'DD-MON-YYYY')
  AND salary > 2500
  ORDER BY employee_id;
```

[Table 6-7](#g1068834) shows the results of applying `OR` to two expressions.

Table 6-7 OR Truth Table

| OR | TRUE | FALSE | UNKNOWN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TRUE | `TRUE` | `TRUE` | `TRUE` |
| FALSE | `TRUE` | `FALSE` | `UNKNOWN` |
| UNKNOWN | `TRUE` | `UNKNOWN` | `UNKNOWN` |

For example, the following query returns employees who have a 40% commission rate or a salary greater than $20,000:

```
SELECT employee_id FROM employees
   WHERE commission_pct = .4 OR salary > 20000
   ORDER BY employee_id;
```
