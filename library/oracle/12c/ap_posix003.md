# Perl-influenced Extensions in Oracle Regular Expressions

Oracle Database regular expression functions and conditions accept a number of Perl-influenced operators that are in common use, although not part of the POSIX standard. [Table D-3](#CEGCDCCF) lists those operators. For more complete descriptions with examples, refer to [Oracle Database Development Guide](../ADFNS/adfns_regexp.md#ADFNS1012).
