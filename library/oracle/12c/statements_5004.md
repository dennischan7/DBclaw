Semantics

When you issue a `CREATE` `CONTROLFILE` statement, Oracle Database creates a new control file based on the information you specify in the statement. The control file resides in the location specified in the `CONTROL_FILES` initialization parameter. If that parameter does not have a value, then the database creates an Oracle-managed control file in the default control file destination, which is one of the following (in order of precedence):

1. One or more control files as specified in the `DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_``n` initialization parameter. The file in the first directory is the primary control file. When `DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_``n` is specified, the database does not create a control file in `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST` or in `DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST` (the fast recovery area).
2. If no value is specified for `DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_``n`, but values are set for both the `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST` and `DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST`, then the database creates one control file in each location. The location specified in `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST` is the primary control file.
3. If a value is specified only for `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST`, then the database creates one control file in that location.
4. If a value is specified only for `DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST`, then the database creates one control file in that location.

If no values are set for any of these parameters, then the database creates a control file in the default location for the operating system on which the database is running. This control file is not an Oracle Managed File.

If you omit any clauses, then Oracle Database uses the default values rather than the values for the previous control file. After successfully creating the control file, Oracle Database mounts the database in the mode specified by the initialization parameter `CLUSTER_DATABASE`. If that parameter is not set, then the default value is `FALSE`, and the database is mounted in `EXCLUSIVE` mode. Oracle recommends that you then shut down the instance and take a full backup of all files in the database.

REUSE

Specify `REUSE` to indicate that existing control files identified by the initialization parameter `CONTROL_FILES` can be reused, overwriting any information they may currently contain. If you omit this clause and any of these control files already exists, then Oracle Database returns an error.

DATABASE Clause

Specify the name of the database. The value of this parameter must be the existing database name established by the previous `CREATE` `DATABASE` statement or `CREATE` `CONTROLFILE` statement.

SET DATABASE Clause

Use `SET` `DATABASE` to change the name of the database. The name of a database can be as long as eight bytes.

When you specify this clause, you must also specify `RESETLOGS`. If you want to rename the database and retain your existing log files, then after issuing this `CREATE` `CONTROLFILE` statement you must complete a full database recovery using an `ALTER` `DATABASE` `RECOVER` `USING` `BACKUP` `CONTROLFILE` statement.

logfile\_clause

Use the `logfile_clause` to specify the redo log files for your database. You must list all members of all redo log file groups.

Use the `redo_log_file_spec` form of `file_specification` (see [file\_specification](clauses004.md#g1057086)) to list regular redo log files in an operating system file system or to list Oracle ASM disk group redo log files. When using a form of `ASM_filename`, you cannot specify the `autoextend_clause` of the `redo_log_file_spec`.

If you specify `RESETLOGS` in this clause, then you must use one of the file creation forms of `ASM_filename`. If you specify `NORESETLOGS`, then you must specify one of the reference forms of `ASM_filename`.

GROUP integer Specify the logfile group number. If you specify `GROUP` values, then Oracle Database verifies these values with the `GROUP` values when the database was last open.

If you omit this clause, then the database creates logfiles using system default values. In addition, if either the `DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_``n` or `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST` initialization parameter has been set, and if you have specified `RESETLOGS`, then the database creates two logs in the default logfile destination specified in the `DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_`n parameter, and if it is not set, then in the `DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST` parameter.

RESETLOGS  Specify `RESETLOGS` if you want Oracle Database to ignore the contents of the files listed in the `LOGFILE` clause. These files do not have to exist. You must specify this clause if you have specified the `SET` `DATABASE` clause.

Each `redo_log_file_spec` in the `LOGFILE` clause must specify the `SIZE` parameter. The database assigns all online redo log file groups to thread 1 and enables this thread for public use by any instance. After using this clause, you must open the database using the `RESETLOGS` clause of the `ALTER` `DATABASE` statement.

NORESETLOGS  Specify `NORESETLOGS` if you want Oracle Database to use all files in the `LOGFILE` clause as they were when the database was last open. These files must exist and must be the current online redo log files rather than restored backups. The database reassigns the redo log file groups to the threads to which they were previously assigned and reenables the threads as they were previously enabled.

You cannot specify `NORESETLOGS` if you have specified the `SET` `DATABASE` clause to change the name of the database. Refer to ["SET DATABASE Clause"](#BABBCFCI) for more information.

DATAFILE Clause

Specify the data files of the database. You must list all data files. These files must all exist, although they may be restored backups that require media recovery.

Do not include in the `DATAFILE` clause any data files in read-only tablespaces. You can add these types of files to the database later. Also, do not include in this clause any temporary data files (temp files).

Use the `datafile_tempfile_spec` form of `file_specification` (see [file\_specification](clauses004.md#g1057086)) to list regular data files and temp files in an operating system file system or to list Oracle ASM disk group files. When using a form of `ASM_filename`, you must use one of the reference forms of `ASM_filename`. Refer to [ASM\_filename](clauses004.md#i1026664) for information on the different forms of syntax.

Restriction on DATAFILE You cannot specify the `autoextend_clause` of `file_specification` in this `DATAFILE` clause.

MAXLOGFILES Clause

Specify the maximum number of online redo log file groups that can ever be created for the database. Oracle Database uses this value to determine how much space to allocate in the control file for the names of redo log files. The default and maximum values depend on your operating system. The value that you specify should not be less than the greatest `GROUP` value for any redo log file group.

MAXLOGMEMBERS Clause

Specify the maximum number of members, or identical copies, for a redo log file group. Oracle Database uses this value to determine how much space to allocate in the control file for the names of redo log files. The minimum value is 1. The maximum and default values depend on your operating system.

MAXLOGHISTORY Clause

This parameter is useful only if you are using Oracle Database in `ARCHIVELOG` mode. Specify your current estimate of the maximum number of archived redo log file groups needed for automatic media recovery of the database. The database uses this value to determine how much space to allocate in the control file for the names of archived redo log files.

The minimum value is 0. The default value is a multiple of the `MAXINSTANCES` value and depends on your operating system. The maximum value is limited only by the maximum size of the control file. The database will continue to add additional space to the appropriate section of the control file as needed, so that you do not need to re-create the control file if your your original configuration is no longer adequate. As a result, the actual value of this parameter can eventually exceed the value you specify.

MAXDATAFILES Clause

Specify the initial sizing of the data files section of the control file at `CREATE` `DATABASE` or `CREATE` `CONTROLFILE` time. An attempt to add a file whose number is greater than `MAXDATAFILES`, but less than or equal to `DB_FILES`, causes the control file to expand automatically so that the data files section can accommodate more files.

The number of data files accessible to your instance is also limited by the initialization parameter `DB_FILES`.

MAXINSTANCES Clause

Specify the maximum number of instances that can simultaneously have the database mounted and open. This value takes precedence over the value of the initialization parameter `INSTANCES`. The minimum value is 1. The maximum and default values depend on your operating system.

ARCHIVELOG | NOARCHIVELOG

Specify `ARCHIVELOG` to archive the contents of redo log files before reusing them. This clause prepares for the possibility of media recovery as well as instance or system failure recovery.

If you omit both the `ARCHIVELOG` clause and `NOARCHIVELOG` clause, then Oracle Database chooses `NOARCHIVELOG` mode by default. After creating the control file, you can change between `ARCHIVELOG` mode and `NOARCHIVELOG` mode with the `ALTER` `DATABASE` statement.

FORCE LOGGING

Use this clause to put the database into `FORCE` `LOGGING` mode after control file creation. When the database is in this mode, Oracle Database logs all changes in the database except changes to temporary tablespaces and temporary segments. This setting takes precedence over and is independent of any `NOLOGGING` or `FORCE` `LOGGING` settings you specify for individual tablespaces and any `NOLOGGING` settings you specify for individual database objects. If you omit this clause, then the database will not be in `FORCE` `LOGGING` mode after the control file is created.

character\_set\_clause

If you specify a character set, then Oracle Database reconstructs character set information in the control file. If media recovery of the database is subsequently required, then this information will be available before the database is open, so that tablespace names can be correctly interpreted during recovery. This clause is required only if you are using a character set other than the default, which depends on your operating system. Oracle Database prints the current database character set to the alert log in `$ORACLE_HOME/log` during startup.

If you are re-creating your control file and you are using Recovery Manager for tablespace recovery, and if you specify a different character set from the one stored in the data dictionary, then tablespace recovery will not succeed. However, at database open, the control file character set will be updated with the correct character set from the data dictionary.

You cannot modify the character set of the database with this clause.
