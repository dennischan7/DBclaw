# REVOKE

Purpose

Use the `REVOKE` statement to:

* Revoke system privileges from users and roles
* Revoke roles from users, roles, and program units.
* Revoke object privileges for a particular object from users and roles

Note on Oracle Automatic Storage Management A user authenticated `AS` `SYSASM` can use this statement to revoke the system privileges `SYSASM`, `SYSOPER`, and `SYSDBA` from a user in the Oracle ASM password file of the current node.

Note on Editionable Objects A `REVOKE` operation to revoke object privileges on an editionable object actualizes the object in the current edition. See [Oracle Database Development Guide](../ADFNS/adfns_editions.md#ADFNS99922) for more information about editions and editionable objects.

Prerequisites

To revoke a system privilege, you must have been granted the privilege with the `ADMIN` `OPTION`. You can revoke any privilege if you have the `GRANT` `ANY` `PRIVILEGE` system privilege.

To revoke a role from a user or another role, you must have been directly granted the role with the `ADMIN` `OPTION` or you must have created the role. You can revoke any role if you have the `GRANT` `ANY` `ROLE` system privilege.

To revoke a role from a program unit, you must be the user `SYS` or you must be the schema owner of the program unit.

To revoke an object privilege, one of the following conditions must be met:

* You must previously have granted the object privilege to the user or role.
* You must have the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE` system privilege. In this case, you can revoke any object privilege that was granted by the object owner or on behalf of the owner by a user with the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE`. However, you cannot revoke an object privilege that was granted by way of a `WITH` `GRANT` `OPTION` grant.

The `REVOKE` statement can revoke only privileges and roles that were previously granted directly with a `GRANT` statement. You cannot use this statement to revoke:

* Privileges or roles not granted to the revokee
* Roles or object privileges granted through the operating system
* Privileges or roles granted to the revokee through roles

To specify the `CONTAINER` clause, you must be connected to a multitenant container database (CDB). To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`, the current container must be the root.

Semantics

revoke\_system\_privileges

Use these clauses to revoke system privileges.

system\_privilege

Specify the system privilege to be revoked. Refer to [Table 18-1](statements_9014.md#BABEFFEE) for a list of the system privileges.

If you revoke a system privilege from a user, then the database removes the privilege from the user's privilege domain. Effective immediately, the user cannot exercise the privilege.

If you revoke a system privilege from a role, then the database removes the privilege from the privilege domain of the role. Effective immediately, users with the role enabled cannot exercise the privilege. Also, other users who have been granted the role and subsequently enable the role cannot exercise the privilege.

If you revoke a system privilege from `PUBLIC`, then the database removes the privilege from the privilege domain of each user who has been granted the privilege through `PUBLIC`. Effective immediately, such users can no longer exercise the privilege. However, the privilege is not revoked from users who have been granted the privilege directly or through roles.

Oracle Database provides a shortcut for specifying all system privileges at once: Specify `ALL` `PRIVILEGES` to revoke all the system privileges listed in [Table 18-1](statements_9014.md#BABEFFEE).

Restriction on Revoking System Privileges A system privilege cannot appear more than once in the list of privileges to be revoked.

role

Specify the role to be revoked.

If you revoke a role from a user, then the database makes the role unavailable to the user. If the role is currently enabled for the user, then the user can continue to exercise the privileges in the role's privilege domain as long as it remains enabled. However, the user cannot subsequently enable the role.

If you revoke a role from another role, then the database removes the privilege domain of the revoked role from the privilege domain of the revokee role. Users who have been granted and have enabled the revokee role can continue to exercise the privileges in the privilege domain of the revoked role as long as the revokee role remains enabled. However, other users who have been granted the revokee role and subsequently enable it cannot exercise the privileges in the privilege domain of the revoked role.

If you revoke a role from `PUBLIC`, then the database makes the role unavailable to all users who have been granted the role through `PUBLIC`. Any user who has enabled the role can continue to exercise the privileges in its privilege domain as long as it remains enabled. However, users cannot subsequently enable the role. The role is not revoked from users who have been granted the role directly or through other roles.

Restriction on Revoking System Roles A system role cannot appear more than once in the list of roles to be revoked. For information on the predefined roles, refer to [Oracle Database Security Guide](../DBSEG/authorization.md#DBSEG4414).

revokee\_clause

Use the `revokee_clause` to specify the users or roles from which the system privilege, role, or object privilege is to be revoked.

PUBLIC Specify `PUBLIC` to revoke the privileges or roles from all users.

revoke\_object\_privileges

Use these clauses to revoke object privileges.

object\_privilege

Specify the object privilege to be revoked. The object privileges, categorized by the type of object to which they apply, are described in [Table 18-2](statements_9014.md#BGBCIIEG).

Note:

Each privilege authorizes some operation. By revoking a privilege, you prevent the revokee from performing that operation. However, multiple users may grant the same privilege to the same user, role, or

`PUBLIC`

. To remove the privilege from the grantee's privilege domain, all grantors must revoke the privilege. If even one grantor does not revoke the privilege, then the grantee can still exercise the privilege by virtue of that grant.

If you revoke an object privilege from a user, then the database removes the privilege from the user's privilege domain. Effective immediately, the user cannot exercise the privilege.

* If that user has granted that privilege to other users or roles, then the database also revokes the privilege from those other users or roles.
* If that user's schema contains a procedure, function, or package that contains SQL statements that exercise the privilege, then the procedure, function, or package can no longer be executed.
* If that user's schema contains a view on that object, then the database invalidates the view.
* If you revoke the `REFERENCES` object privilege from a user who has exercised the privilege to define referential integrity constraints, then you must specify the `CASCADE` `CONSTRAINTS` clause.

If you revoke an object privilege from a role, then the database removes the privilege from the privilege domain of the role. Effective immediately, users with the role enabled cannot exercise the privilege. Other users who have been granted the role cannot exercise the privilege after enabling the role.

If you revoke an object privilege from `PUBLIC`, then the database removes the privilege from the privilege domain of each user who has been granted the privilege through `PUBLIC`. Effective immediately, all such users are restricted from exercising the privilege. However, the privilege is not revoked from users who have been granted the privilege directly or through roles.

ALL [PRIVILEGES]

Specify `ALL` to revoke all object privileges that you have granted to the revokee. (The keyword `PRIVILEGES` is provided for semantic clarity and is optional.)

If no privileges have been granted on the object, then the database takes no action and does not return an error.

Restriction on Revoking Object Privileges A privilege cannot appear more than once in the list of privileges to be revoked. A user, a role, or `PUBLIC` cannot appear more than once in the `FROM` clause.

CASCADE CONSTRAINTS

This clause is relevant only if you revoke the `REFERENCES` privilege or `ALL` [`PRIVILEGES`]. It drops any referential integrity constraints that the revokee has defined using the `REFERENCES` privilege, which might have been granted either explicitly or implicitly through a grant of `ALL` [`PRIVILEGES`].

FORCE

Specify `FORCE` to revoke the `EXECUTE` object privilege on user-defined type objects with table or type dependencies. You must use `FORCE` to revoke the `EXECUTE` object privilege on user-defined type objects with table dependencies.

If you specify `FORCE`, then all privileges are revoked, all dependent objects are marked `INVALID`, data in dependent tables becomes inaccessible, and all dependent function-based indexes are marked `UNUSABLE`. Regranting the necessary type privilege will revalidate the table.

on\_object\_clause

The `on_object_clause` identifies the objects on which privileges are to be revoked.

object  Specify the object on which the object privileges are to be revoked. This object can be:

* A table, view, sequence, procedure, stored function, package, or materialized view
* A synonym for a table, view, sequence, procedure, stored function, package, materialized view, or user-defined type
* A library, indextype, or user-defined operator

If you do not qualify object with `schema`, then the database assumes the object is in your own schema.

If you revoke the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on the containing table or materialized view of a materialized view, whether the privilege was granted with or without the `GRANT` `OPTION`, then the database invalidates the materialized view.

If you revoke the `READ` or `SELECT` object privilege on any of the master tables of a materialized view, whether the privilege was granted with or without the `GRANT` `OPTION`, then the database invalidates both the materialized view and its containing table or materialized view.

ON USER Specify one or more database users on whom privileges are to be revoked.

ON DIRECTORY Specify the name of the directory object on which privileges are to be revoked. You cannot qualify `directory_name` with a schema name.

ON EDITION Specify the name of the edition on which the `USE` object privilege is to be revoked. You cannot qualify `edition_name` with a schema name.

ON MINING MODEL Specify the name of the mining model on which privileges are to be revoked. If you do not qualify `mining_model_name` with `schema`, then the database assumes that the mining model is in your own schema.

ON JAVA SOURCE | RESOURCE Specify the name of the Java source or resource schema object on which privileges are to be revoked. If you do not qualify `object` with `schema`, then the database assumes that the object is in your own schema.

ON SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE Specify the name of the SQL translation profile on which privileges are to be revoked. If you do not qualify `profile` with `schema`, then the database assumes the profile is in your own schema.

revoke\_roles\_from\_programs

Use this clause to revoke code based access control (CBAC) roles from program units.

role

Specify the role you want to revoke.

ALL

Specify `ALL` to revoke all roles that are granted to the program unit.

program\_unit

Specify the program unit from which the role is to be revoked. You can specify a PL/SQL function, procedure, or package. If you do not specify `schema`, then Oracle Database assumes the function, procedure, or package is in your own schema.

CONTAINER Clause

If the current container is a pluggable database (PDB):

* Specify `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT` to revoke a locally granted system privilege, object privilege, or role from a local user, common user, local role, or common role. The privilege or role is revoked from the user or role only in the current PDB. This clause does not revoke privileges granted with `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`.

If the current container is the root:

* Specify `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT` to revoke a locally granted system privilege, object privilege, or role from a common user or common role. The privilege or role is revoked from the user or role only in the root. This clause does not revoke privileges granted with `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`.
* Specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL` to revoke a commonly granted system privilege, object privilege on a common object, or role from a common user or common role. The privilege or role is revoked from the user or role across the entire CDB. This clause can revoke only a privilege or role granted with `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL` from the specified common user or common role. This clause does not revoke privileges granted locally with `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT`. However, any locally granted privileges that depend on the commonly granted privilege being revoked are also revoked.

If you omit this clause, then `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT` is the default.

Examples

Revoking a System Privilege from a User: Example The following statement revokes the `DROP` `ANY` `TABLE` system privilege from the users `hr` and `oe`:

```
REVOKE DROP ANY TABLE 
    FROM hr, oe;
```

The users `hr` and `oe` can no longer drop tables in schemas other than their own.

Revoking a Role from a User: Example The following statement revokes the role `dw_manager` from the user `sh`:

```
REVOKE dw_manager 
    FROM sh;
```

The user `sh` can no longer enable the `dw_manager` role.

Revoking a System Privilege from a Role: Example The following statement revokes the `CREATE` `TABLESPACE` system privilege from the `dw_manager` role:

```
REVOKE CREATE TABLESPACE 
   FROM dw_manager;
```

Enabling the `dw_manager` role no longer allows users to create tablespaces.

Revoking a Role from a Role: Example To revoke the role `dw_user` from the role `dw_manager`, issue the following statement:

```
REVOKE dw_user
  FROM dw_manager;
```

The `dw_user` role privileges are no longer granted to `dw_manager`.

Revoking an Object Privilege from a User: Example You can grant `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `READ`, `SELECT`, and `UPDATE` privileges on the table `orders` to the user `hr` with the following statement:

```
GRANT ALL 
   ON orders TO hr;
```

To revoke the `DELETE` privilege on `orders` from `hr`, issue the following statement:

```
REVOKE DELETE 
   ON orders FROM hr;
```

Revoking All Object Privileges from a User: Example To revoke the remaining privileges on `orders` that you granted to `hr`, issue the following statement:

```
REVOKE ALL 
   ON orders FROM hr;
```

Revoking Object Privileges from PUBLIC: Example You can grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the view `emp_details_view` to all users by granting the privileges to the role `PUBLIC`:

```
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE 
    ON emp_details_view TO public;
```

The following statement revokes `UPDATE` privilege on `emp_details_view` from all users:

```
REVOKE UPDATE 
    ON emp_details_view FROM public;
```

Users can no longer update the `emp_details_view` view, although users can still query it. However, if you have also granted the `UPDATE` privilege on `emp_details_view` to any users, either directly or through roles, then these users retain the privilege.

Revoking an Object Privilege on a User from a User: Example You can grant the user `hr` the `INHERIT` `PRIVILEGES` privilege on user `sh` with the following statement:

```
GRANT INHERIT PRIVILEGES ON USER sh TO hr;
```

To revoke the `INHERIT` `PRIVILEGES` privilege on user `sh` from user `hr`, issue the following statement:

```
REVOKE INHERIT PRIVILEGES ON USER sh FROM hr;
```

Revoking an Object Privilege on a Sequence from a User: Example You can grant the user `oe` the `SELECT` privilege on the `departments_seq` sequence in the schema `hr` with the following statement:

```
GRANT SELECT 
    ON hr.departments_seq TO oe;
```

To revoke the `SELECT` privilege on `departments_seq` from `oe`, issue the following statement:

```
REVOKE SELECT 
    ON hr.departments_seq FROM oe;
```

However, if the user `hr` has also granted `SELECT` privilege on `departments` to `sh`, then `sh` can still use `departments` by virtue of `hr`'s grant.

Revoking an Object Privilege with CASCADE CONSTRAINTS: Example You can grant to `oe` the privileges `REFERENCES` and `UPDATE` on the `employees` table in the schema `hr` with the following statement:

```
GRANT REFERENCES, UPDATE 
    ON hr.employees TO oe;
```

The user `oe` can exercise the `REFERENCES` privilege to define a constraint in his or her own `dependent` table that refers to the `employees` table in the schema `hr`:

```
CREATE TABLE dependent 
(dependno   NUMBER, 
 dependname VARCHAR2(10), 
 employee   NUMBER                   
    CONSTRAINT in_emp REFERENCES hr.employees(employee_id) );
```

You can revoke the `REFERENCES` privilege on `hr.employees` from `oe` by issuing the following statement that contains the `CASCADE` `CONSTRAINTS` clause:

```
REVOKE REFERENCES 
    ON hr.employees 
    FROM oe 
    CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
```

Revoking `oe`'s `REFERENCES` privilege on `hr.employees` causes Oracle Database to drop the `in_emp` constraint, because `oe` required the privilege to define the constraint.

However, if `oe` has also been granted the `REFERENCES` privilege on `hr.employees` by a user other than you, then the database does not drop the constraint. `oe` still has the privilege necessary for the constraint by virtue of the other user's grant.

Revoking an Object Privilege on a Directory from a User: Example You can revoke the `READ` object privilege on directory `bfile_dir` from `hr` by issuing the following statement:

```
REVOKE READ ON DIRECTORY bfile_dir FROM hr;
```

Revoke Operations that Use GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE: Example Suppose that the database administrator has granted `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE` to user `sh`. Now suppose that user `hr` grants the update privilege on the `employees` table to `oe`:

```
CONNECT hr
GRANT UPDATE ON employees TO oe WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

This grant gives user `oe` the right to pass the object privilege along to another user:

```
CONNECT oe
GRANT UPDATE ON hr.employees TO pm;
```

User `sh`, who has the `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE`, can now act on behalf of user `hr` and revoke the update privilege from user `oe`, because `oe` was granted the privilege by `hr`:

```
CONNECT sh
REVOKE UPDATE ON hr.employees FROM oe;
```

User `sh` cannot revoke the update privilege from user `pm` explicitly, because `pm` received the grant neither from the object owner (`hr`), nor from `sh`, nor from another user with `GRANT` `ANY` `OBJECT` `PRIVILEGE`, but from user `oe`. However, the preceding statement cascades, removing all privileges that depend on the one revoked. Therefore the object privilege is implicitly revoked from `pm` as well.
