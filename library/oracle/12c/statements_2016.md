Prerequisites

To modify a private synonym in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE` `ANY` `SYNONYM` and `DROP` `ANY` `SYNONYM` system privileges.

To modify a `PUBLIC` synonym, you must have the `CREATE` `PUBLIC` `SYNONYM` and `DROP` `PUBLIC` `SYNONYM` system privileges.

Semantics

PUBLIC

Specify `PUBLIC` if `synonym` is a public synonym. You cannot use this clause to change a public synonym to a private synonym, or vice versa.

schema

Specify the schema containing the synonym. If you omit `schema`, then Oracle Database assumes the synonym is in your own schema.

synonym

Specify the name of the synonym to be altered.

EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE

Use these clauses to specify whether the synonym becomes an editioned or noneditioned object if editioning is later enabled for the schema object type `SYNONYM` in `schema`. The default is `EDITIONABLE`. For information about altering editioned and noneditioned objects, see [Oracle Database Development Guide](../ADFNS/adfns_editions.md#ADFNS1287).

Restriction on EDITIONABLE | NONEDITIONABLE You cannot specify these clauses for a public synonym because editioning is always enabled for the object type `SYNONYM` in the `PUBLIC` schema.

COMPILE

Use this clause to compile `synonym`. A synonym places a dependency on its target object and becomes invalid if the target object is changed or dropped. When you compile an invalid synonym, it becomes valid again.

Note:

You can determine if a synonym is valid or invalid by querying the

`STATUS`

column of the

`ALL_`

,

`DBA_`

, and

`USER_OBJECTS`

data dictionary views.

Examples

The following examples modify synonyms that were created in the `CREATE` `SYNONYM` ["Examples"](statements_7001.md#g2266838).

The following statement compiles synonym `offices`:

```
ALTER SYNONYM offices COMPILE;
```

The following statement compiles public synonym `emp_table`:

```
ALTER PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_table COMPILE;
```

The following statement causes synonym `offices` to remain a noneditioned object if editioning is later enabled for schema object type `SYNONYM` in the schema that contains the synonym `offices`:

```
ALTER SYNONYM offices NONEDITIONABLE;
```
