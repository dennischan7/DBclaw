# RATIO\_TO\_REPORT

Syntax

See Also:

["Analytic Functions"](functions004.md#i81407)

for information on syntax, semantics, and restrictions, including valid forms of

`expr`

Purpose

`RATIO_TO_REPORT` is an analytic function. It computes the ratio of a value to the sum of a set of values. If `expr` evaluates to null, then the ratio-to-report value also evaluates to null.

The set of values is determined by the `query_partition_clause`. If you omit that clause, then the ratio-to-report is computed over all rows returned by the query.

You cannot nest analytic functions by using `RATIO_TO_REPORT` or any other analytic function for `expr`. However, you can use other built-in function expressions for `expr`. Refer to ["About SQL Expressions"](expressions001.md#i1002626) for information on valid forms of `expr`.

Examples

The following example calculates the ratio-to-report value of each purchasing clerk's salary to the total of all purchasing clerks' salaries:

```
SELECT last_name, salary, RATIO_TO_REPORT(salary) OVER () AS rr
   FROM employees
   WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK'
   ORDER BY last_name, salary, rr;

LAST_NAME                     SALARY         RR
