# LEAD

Syntax

See Also:

["Analytic Functions"](functions004.md#i81407)

for information on syntax, semantics, and restrictions, including valid forms of

`value_expr`

Purpose

`LEAD` is an analytic function. It provides access to more than one row of a table at the same time without a self join. Given a series of rows returned from a query and a position of the cursor, `LEAD` provides access to a row at a given physical offset beyond that position.

If you do not specify `offset`, then its default is 1. The optional `default` value is returned if the offset goes beyond the scope of the table. If you do not specify `default`, then its default value is null.

{`RESPECT` | `IGNORE`} `NULLS` determines whether null values of `value_expr` are included in or eliminated from the calculation. The default is `RESPECT` `NULLS`.

You cannot nest analytic functions by using `LEAD` or any other analytic function for `value_expr`. However, you can use other built-in function expressions for `value_expr`.

Examples

The following example provides, for each employee in Department 30 in the `employees` table, the hire date of the employee hired just after:

```
SELECT hire_date, last_name,
       LEAD(hire_date, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS "NextHired" 
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id = 30
  ORDER BY hire_date;

HIRE_DATE LAST_NAME                 Next Hired
