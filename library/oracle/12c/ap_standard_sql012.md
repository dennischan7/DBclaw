# Oracle Compliance with FIPS 127-2

Oracle complied fully with last Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), which was FIPS PUB 127-2. That standard is no longer published. However, for users whose applications depend on information about the sizes of some database constructs that were defined in FIPS 127-2, the details of our compliance are listed in [Table C-4](#CHDDDDEB).

Table C-4 Sizing for Database Constructs

| Database Constructs | FIPS | Oracle Database |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Length of an identifier (in bytes) | 18 | 30 |
| Length of `CHARACTER` data type (in bytes) | 240 | 2,000 |
| Decimal precision of `NUMERIC` data type | 15 | 38 |
| Decimal precision of `DECIMAL` data type | 15 | 38 |
| Decimal precision of `INTEGER` data type | 9 | 38 |
| Decimal precision of `SMALLINT` data type | 4 | 38 |
| Binary precision of `FLOAT` data type | 20 | 126 |
| Binary precision of `REAL` data type | 20 | 63 |
| Binary precision of `DOUBLE` `PRECISION` data type | 30 | 126 |
| Columns in a table | 100 | 1,000 |
| Values in an `INSERT` statement | 100 | 1,000 |
| SET clauses in an `UPDATE` statement (Note 1) | 20 | 1,000 |
| Length of a row (Note2, Note 3) | 2,000 | 2,000,000 |
| Columns in a `UNIQUE` constraint | 6 | 32 |
| Length of a `UNIQUE` constraint (Note 2) | 120 | (Note 4) |
| Length of foreign key column list (Note 2) | 120 | (Note 4) |
| Columns in a `GROUP` `BY` clause | 6 | 255 (Note 5) |
| Length of `GROUP` `BY` column list | 120 | (Note 5) |
| Sort specifications in `ORDER` `BY` clause | 6 | 255 (Note 5) |
| Length of `ORDER` `BY` column list | 120 | (Note 5) |
| Columns in a referential integrity constraint | 6 | 32 |
| Tables referenced in a SQL statement | 15 | No limit |
| Cursors simultaneously open | 10 | (Note 6) |
| Items in a `SELECT` list | 100 | 1,000 |

Note 1: The number of `SET` clauses in an `UPDATE` statement refers to the number items separated by commas following the `SET` keyword.

Note 2: The FIPS PUB defines the length of a collection of columns to be the sum of: twice the number of columns, the length of each character column in bytes, decimal precision plus 1 of each exact numeric column, binary precision divided by 4 plus 1 of each approximate numeric column.

Note 3: The Oracle limit for the maximum row length is based on the maximum length of a row containing a `LONG` value of length 2 gigabytes and 999 `VARCHAR2` values, each of length 4000 bytes: 2(254) + 231 + (999(4000)).

Note 4: The Oracle limit for a `UNIQUE` key is half the size of an Oracle data block (specified by the initialization parameter `DB_BLOCK_SIZE`) minus some overhead.

Note 5: Oracle places no limit on the number of columns in a `GROUP` `BY` clause or the number of sort specifications in an `ORDER` `BY` clause. However, the sum of the sizes of all the expressions in either a `GROUP` `BY` clause or an `ORDER` `BY` clause is limited to the size of an Oracle data block (specified by the initialization parameter `DB_BLOCK_SIZE`) minus some overhead.

Note 6: The Oracle limit for the number of cursors simultaneously opened is specified by the initialization parameter `OPEN_CURSORS`. The maximum value of this parameter depends on the memory available on your operating system and exceeds 100 in all cases.
