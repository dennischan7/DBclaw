"[Analytic Functions](Analytic-Functions.md#GUID-527832F7-63C0-4445-8C16-307FA5084056)" for information on syntax, semantics, and restrictions of the `ORDER` `BY` clause and `OVER` clause

`FIRST` and `LAST` are very similar functions. Both are aggregate and analytic functions that operate on a set of values from a set of rows that rank as the `FIRST` or `LAST` with respect to a given sorting specification. If only one row ranks as `FIRST` or `LAST`, then the aggregate operates on the set with only one element.

If you omit the `OVER` clause, then the `FIRST` and `LAST` functions are treated as aggregate functions. You can use these functions as analytic functions by specifying the `OVER` clause. The `query_partition_clause` is the only part of the `OVER` clause valid with these functions. If you include the `OVER` clause but omit the `query_partition_clause`, then the function is treated as an analytic function, but the window defined for analysis is the entire table.

These functions take as an argument any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of the argument.

When you need a value from the first or last row of a sorted group, but the needed value is not the sort key, the `FIRST` and `LAST` functions eliminate the need for self-joins or views and enable better performance.

* The `aggregate_function` argument is any one of the `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `VARIANCE`, or `STDDEV` functions. It operates on values from the rows that rank either `FIRST` or `LAST`. If only one row ranks as `FIRST` or `LAST`, then the aggregate operates on a singleton (nonaggregate) set.
* The `KEEP` keyword is for semantic clarity. It qualifies `aggregate_function`, indicating that only the `FIRST` or `LAST` values of `aggregate_function` will be returned.
* `DENSE_RANK` `FIRST` or `DENSE_RANK` `LAST` indicates that Oracle Database will aggregate over only those rows with the minimum (`FIRST`) or the maximum (`LAST`) dense rank (also called olympic rank).

The following example returns, within each department of the sample table `hr.employees`, the minimum salary among the employees who make the lowest commission and the maximum salary among the employees who make the highest commission:

```
SELECT department_id,
       MIN(salary) KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY commission_pct) "Worst",
       MAX(salary) KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY commission_pct) "Best"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;

DEPARTMENT_ID      Worst       Best
------------- ---------- ----------
           10       4400       4400
           20       6000      13000
           30       2500      11000
           40       6500       6500
           50       2100       8200
           60       4200       9000
           70      10000      10000
           80       6100      14000
           90      17000      24000
          100       6900      12008
          110       8300      12008
                    7000       7000
```

The next example makes the same calculation as the previous example but returns the result for each employee within the department:

```
SELECT last_name, department_id, salary,
       MIN(salary) KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY commission_pct)
         OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) "Worst",
       MAX(salary) KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY commission_pct)
         OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) "Best"
   FROM employees
   ORDER BY department_id, salary, last_name;

LAST_NAME           DEPARTMENT_ID     SALARY      Worst       Best
------------------- ------------- ---------- ---------- ----------

Fay                            20       6000       6000      13000
