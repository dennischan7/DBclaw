# Oracle 23c - APPROX_PERCENTILE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/APPROX_PERCENTILE.html

Purpose

`APPROX_PERCENTILE` is an approximate inverse distribution function. It takes a percentile value and a sort specification, and returns the value that would fall into that percentile value with respect to the sort specification. Nulls are ignored in the calculation

This function provides an alternative to the `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC` functions, which returns the exact results. `APPROX_PERCENTILE` processes large amounts of data significantly faster than `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC`, with negligible deviation from the exact result.

The first `expr` is the percentile value, which must evaluate to a numeric value between 0 and 1.

The second `expr`, which is part of the `ORDER` `BY` clause, is a single expression over which this function calculates the result. The acceptable data types for `expr`, and the return value data type for this function, depend on the algorithm that you specify with the `DETERMINISTIC` clause.

DETERMINISTIC

This clause lets you specify the type of algorithm this function uses to calculate the return value.

* If you specify `DETERMINISTIC`, then this function calculates a deterministic result. In this case, the `ORDER` `BY` clause expression must evaluate to a numeric value, or to a value that can be implicitly converted to a numeric value, in the range -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647. The function rounds numeric input to the closest integer. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of the `ORDER` `BY` clause expression. The return value is not necessarily one of the values of `expr`
* If you omit `DETERMINSTIC`, then this function calculates a nondeterministic result. In this case, the `ORDER` `BY` clause expression must evaluate to a numeric or datetime value, or to a value that can be implicitly converted to a numeric or datetime value. The function returns the same data type as the numeric or datetime data type of the `ORDER` `BY` clause expression. The return value is one of the values of `expr`.

ERROR\_RATE | CONFIDENCE

These clauses let you determine the accuracy of the result calculated by this function. If you specify one of these clauses, then instead of returning the value that would fall into the specified percentile value for `expr`, the function returns a decimal value from 0 to 1, inclusive, which represents one of the following values:

* If you specify `ERROR_RATE`, then the return value represents the error rate for calculating the value that would fall into the specified percentile value for`expr`.
* If you specify `CONFIDENCE`, then the return value represents the confidence level for the error rate that is returned when you specify `ERROR_RATE`.

DESC | ASC

Specify the sort specification for the calculating the value that would fall into the specified percentile value. Specify `DESC` to sort the `ORDER` `BY` clause expression values in descending order, or `ASC` to sort the values in ascending order. `ASC` is the default.

Examples

The following query returns the deterministic approximate 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile salaries for each department in the `hr`.`employees` table. The salaries are sorted in ascending order for the interpolation calculation.

```

       APPROX_PERCENTILE(0.25 DETERMINISTIC)
         WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary ASC) "25th Percentile Salary",

         WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary ASC) "50th Percentile Salary",
       APPROX_PERCENTILE(0.75 DETERMINISTIC)
         WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary ASC) "75th Percentile Salary"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;
