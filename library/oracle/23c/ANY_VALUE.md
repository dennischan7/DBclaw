# Oracle 23c - ANY_VALUE
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/ANY_VALUE.html

Purpose

`ANY_VALUE` returns a single non-deterministic value of `expr`. You can use it as an aggregate function.

Use `ANY_VALUE` to optimize a query that has a `GROUP BY` clause. `ANY_VALUE` returns a value of an expression in a group. It is optimized to return the first value.

It ensures that there are no comparisons for any incoming row and also eliminates the necessity to specify every column as part of the `GROUP BY` clause. Because it does not compare values, `ANY_VALUE` returns a value more quickly than `MIN` or `MAX` in a `GROUP BY` query.

Semantics

`ALL`, `DISTINCT`: These keywords are supported by `ANY_VALUE` although they have no effect on the result of the query.

`expr`: The expression can be a column, constant, bind variable, or an expression involving them.

NULL values in the expression are ignored.

Supports all of the data types, except for `LONG`, `LOB`, `FILE`, or `COLLECTION`.

If you use `LONG`, `ORA-00997` is raised.

If you use `LOB`, `FILE`, or `COLLECTION` data types, `ORA-00932` is raised.

`ANY_VALUE` follows the same rules as `MIN` and `MAX`.

Returns any value within each group based on the `GROUP BY` specification. Returns NULL if all rows in the group have NULL expression values.

The result of `ANY_VALUE` is not deterministic.

Example 7-1 Using ANY\_VALUE As an Aggregate Function

This example uses `ANY_VALUE` as an aggregate function in a `GROUP BY` query of the SH schema.

```
SELECT c.cust_id, ANY_VALUE(cust_last_name), SUM(amount_sold)
  FROM customers c, sales s
  WHERE s.cust_id = c.cust_id
  GROUP BY c.cust_id;
```

In the following result of the query, only the first eleven rows are shown.

```
CUST_ID  ANY_VALUE(CUST_LAST_NAME) SUM(AMOUNT_SOLD)
