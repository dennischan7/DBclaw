# Oracle 23c - CREATE-USER
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/CREATE-USER.html

Purpose

Use the `CREATE` `USER` statement to create and configure a database user, which is an account through which you can log in to the database, and to establish the means by which Oracle Database permits access by the user.

You can issue this statement in an Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) cluster to add a user and password combination to the password file that is local to the Oracle ASM instance of the current node. Each node's Oracle ASM instance can use this statement to update its own password file. The password file itself must have been created by the `ORAPWD` utility.

You can enable a user to connect to the database through a proxy application or application server. For syntax and discussion, refer to [ALTER USER](ALTER-USER.md#GUID-9FCD038D-8193-4241-85CD-2F4723B27D44).

Prerequisites

You must have the `CREATE` `USER` system privilege. When you create a user with the `CREATE` `USER` statement, the user's privilege domain is empty. To log on to Oracle Database, a user must have the `CREATE` `SESSION` system privilege. Therefore, after creating a user, you should grant the user at least the `CREATE` `SESSION` system privilege. Refer to [GRANT](GRANT.md#GUID-20B4E2C0-A7F8-4BC8-A5E8-BE61BDC41AC3) for more information.

Only a user authenticated `AS` `SYSASM` can issue this command to modify the Oracle ASM instance password file.

To specify the `CONTAINER` clause, you must be connected to a multitenant container database (CDB). To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`, the current container must be the root. To specify `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT`, the current container must be a pluggable database (PDB).

IF NOT EXISTS

Specifying `IF NOT EXISTS` has the following effects:

* If the user does not exist, a new user is created at the end of the statement.
* If the user exists, this is the user you have at the end of the statement. A new one is not created because the older one is detected.

Using `IF EXISTS` with `CREATE` results in `ORA-11543: Incorrect IF NOT EXISTS clause for CREATE statement`.

user

Specify the name of the user to be created. This name can contain only characters from your database character set and must follow the rules described in the section "[Database Object Naming Rules](Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.md#GUID-75337742-67FD-4EC0-985F-741C93D918DA)". Oracle recommends that the user name contain at least one single-byte character regardless of whether the database character set also contains multibyte characters.

In a non-CDB, a user name cannot begin with `C##` or `c##`.

Note:

A multitenant container database is the only supported architecture in Oracle
Database 21c and later releases. While the documentation is
being revised, legacy terminology may persist. In most
cases, "database" and "non-CDB" refer to a CDB or PDB,
depending on context. In some contexts, such as upgrades,
"non-CDB" refers to a non-CDB from a previous release.

In a CDB, the requirements for a user name are as follows:

* The name of a common user must begin with characters that are a case-insensitive match to the prefix specified by the `COMMON_USER_PREFIX` initialization parameter. By default, the prefix is `C##`.
* The name of a local user must not begin with characters that are a case-insensitive match to the prefix specified by the `COMMON_USER_PREFIX` initialization parameter. Regardless of the value of `COMMON_USER_PREFIX`, the name of a local user can never begin with `C##` or `c##`.

Note:

If the value of `COMMON_USER_PREFIX` is an empty string, then there are no requirements for common or local user names with one exception: the name of a local user can never begin with `C##` or `c##`. Oracle recommends against using an empty string value because it might result in conflicts between the names of local and common users when a PDB is plugged into a different CDB, or when opening a PDB that was closed when a common user was created.

Note:

Oracle recommends that user names and passwords be encoded in ASCII or EBCDIC characters only, depending on your platform.

IDENTIFIED Clause

The `IDENTIFIED` clause lets you indicate how Oracle Database authenticates the user.

BY password

The `BY` `password` clause lets you creates a local user and indicates that the user must specify `password` to log on to the database. Passwords are case sensitive and their maximum length is 1024 bytes. Any subsequent `CONNECT` string used to connect this user to the database must specify the password using the same case (upper, lower, or mixed) that is used in this `CREATE` `USER` statement or a subsequent `ALTER` `USER` statement. Passwords can contain any single-byte, multibyte, or special characters, or any combination of these, from your database character set, with the exception of the double quotation mark (") and the return character . If a password starts with a non-alphabetic character, or contains a character other than an alphanumeric character, the underscore (\_), dollar sign ($), or pound sign (#), then it must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Otherwise, enclosing a password in double quotation marks is optional.

Passwords must follow the rules described in the section "[Database Object Naming Rules](Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.md#GUID-75337742-67FD-4EC0-985F-741C93D918DA)", unless you are using one of the three Oracle Database password complexity verification routines. These routines requires a more complex combination of characters than the normal naming rules permit. You implement these routines with the `UTLPWDMG.SQL` script, which is further described in [Oracle Database Security Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf&id=DBSEG845).

Note:

Oracle recommends that user names and passwords be encoded in ASCII or EBCDIC characters only, depending on your platform.

[HTTP] DIGEST Clause

This clause lets you `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` HTTP Digest Access Authentication for the user. The default is `DISABLE`.

The `HTTP` keyword is optional and is provided for semantic clarity.

Restriction on the [HTTP] DIGEST Clause

You cannot specify this clause for external or global users.

AND FACTOR 'auth\_method' AS 'external\_name'

Use this clause to specify second factor authentication for native database users.

`auth_method` can be one of `cert_auth`, `duo_push`, `oma_push`, `totp_auth`.

For more see [Configuring Authentication](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf&id=DBSEG-GUID-10E4F568-0FA3-4F82-99AA-14FB2947469C) of the Database Security Guide.

EXTERNALLY Clause

Specify `EXTERNALLY` to create an external user. Such a user must be authenticated by an external service, such as an operating system or a third-party service. In this case, Oracle Database relies on authentication by the operating system or third-party service to ensure that a specific external user has access to a specific database user.

The `IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY` clause setting is unique to the user that is specified in the `CREATE USER` statement. This means that you cannot create another user with the same name used in a previous user creation statement.

The following example creates the external user `jsmith`:

```
CREATE USER jsmith IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY AS "CN=foo,DNQ=123,SERIAL=234";
```

Now create another external user `tjones` with the same name `CN=foo,dnQualifier=123,SERIALNUMER=234` :

```
CREATE USER tjones IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY AS "CN=foo,dnQualifier=123,SERIALNUMER=234";
```

The user `tjones` is not created because the command fails with the error: `User with same external name already exists` because the `CN=foo,dnQualifier=123,SerialNumber=234` setting has already been used. This happens because `dnq=` is converted to `dnqualifier=` and `serial=` is converted to `serialnumber=` internally, and therefore, `CN=foo,DNQ=123,SERIAL=234` and `CN=foo,dnQualifier=123,SerialNumber=234` are treated as the same user.

AS 'certificate\_DN'

This clause is required for and used for SSL-authenticated external users only. The `certificate_DN` is the distinguished name in the user's PKI certificate in the user's wallet. The maximum length of `certificate_DN` is 1024 characters.

AS 'kerberos\_principal\_name'

This clause is required for and used for Kerberos-authenticated external users only. The maximum length of `kerberos_principal_name` is 1024 characters.

Note:

Oracle strongly recommends that you do not use `IDENTIFIED` `EXTERNALLY` with operating systems that have inherently weak login security.

Restriction on Creating External Users

Oracle ASM does not support the creation of external users.

GLOBALLY Clause

The `GLOBALLY` clause lets you create a global user. Such a user must be authorized by the enterprise directory service (Oracle Internet Directory).

The `directory_DN` string can take one of two forms:

* The X.509 name at the enterprise directory service that identifies this user. It should be of the form `CN=``username,other_attributes`, where `other_attributes` is the rest of the user's distinguished name (DN) in the directory. This form uses the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) and creates a private global schema.
* A null string (' ') indicating that the enterprise directory service will map authenticated global users to this database schema with the appropriate roles. This form is the same as specifying the `GLOBALLY` keyword alone and creates a shared global schema.

The maximum length of `directory_DN` is 1024 characters.

You can control the ability of an application server to connect as the specified user and to activate that user's roles using the `ALTER` `USER` statement.

You can exclusively map an Oracle Database schema to a Microsoft Azure AD user using `GLOBALLY AS AZURE_USER`. You must log in to the Oracle Autonomous Database instance as a user who has been granted the `CREATE USER` or `ALTER USER` system privilege.

Example: Map Oracle Database Schema to a Microsoft Azure AD User

The example creates a new database schema user named `peter_fitch` and maps this user to an existing Azure AD user named `peter.fitch@example.com`:

```
CREATE USER peter_fitch IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY AS 'AZURE_USER=peter.fitch@example.com';
```

Example: Map a Shared Oracle Database Schema to an App Role

The example creates a new database global user account (schema) named `dba_azure` and maps it to an existing Azure AD application role named `AZURE_DBA`:

```
CREATE USER dba_azure IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY AS 'AZURE_ROLE=AZURE_DBA';
```

Restriction on Creating Global Users

Oracle ASM does not support the creation of global users.

NO AUTHENTICATION Clause

Use the `NO AUTHENTICATION` clause to create a schema that does not have a password and cannot be logged into. This is intended for schema only accounts and reduces maintenance by removing default passwords and any requirement to rotate the password.

DEFAULT COLLATION Clause

This clause lets you specify the default collation for the schema owned by the user. The default collation is assigned to tables, views, and materialized views that are subsequently created in the schema.

For `collation_name`, specify a valid named collation or pseudo-collation.

If you omit this clause, then the default collation for the schema owned by the user is set to the `USING_NLS_COMP` pseudo-collation.

You can override this clause and assign a different default collation to a particular table, materialized view, or view by specifying the `DEFAULT` `COLLATION` clause of the `CREATE` or `ALTER` statement for the table, materialized view, or view. You can also override the default collations of all schemas for the duration of a database session by setting the default collation for the session. See the [DEFAULT\_COLLATION](ALTER-SESSION.md#GUID-27186B28-7EFC-4998-B1ED-2B905CC0211B__DEFAULT_COLLATION-39CF7241) clause of `ALTER` `SESSION` for more details.

You can specify the `DEFAULT` `COLLATION` clause only if the `COMPATIBLE` initialization parameter is set to `12.2` or greater, and the `MAX_STRING_SIZE` initialization parameter is set to `EXTENDED`.

DEFAULT TABLESPACE Clause

Specify the default tablespace for objects that are created in the user's schema. If you omit this clause, then the user's objects are stored in the database default tablespace. If no default tablespace has been specified for the database, then the user's objects are stored in the `SYSTEM` tablespace.

Restriction on Default Tablespaces

You cannot specify a locally managed temporary tablespace, including an undo tablespace, or a dictionary-managed temporary tablespace, as a user's default tablespace.

[LOCAL] TEMPORARY TABLESPACE Clause

Specify the tablespace or tablespace group for the user's temporary segments. If you omit this clause, then the user's temporary segments are stored in the database default temporary tablespace or, if none has been specified, in the `SYSTEM` tablespace.

* Specify `tablespace` to indicate the user's temporary tablespace. Specify `TEMPORARY` `TABLESPACE` to indicate a shared temporary tablespace. Specify `LOCAL` `TEMPORARY` `TABLESPACE` to indicate a local temporary tablespace. If you are connected to a CDB, then you can specify `CDB$DEFAULT` to use the CDB-wide default temporary tablespace.
* Specify `tablespace_group_name` to indicate that the user can save temporary segments in any tablespace in the tablespace group specified by `tablespace_group_name`. Local temporary tablespaces cannot be part of a tablespace group.

Restrictions on Temporary Tablespace

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

QUOTA Clause

Use the `QUOTA` clause to specify the maximum amount of space the user can allocate in the tablespace.

A `CREATE` `USER` statement can have multiple `QUOTA` clauses for multiple tablespaces.

`UNLIMITED` lets the user allocate space in the tablespace without bound.

The maximum amount of space that you can specify is 2 terabytes (TB). If you need more space, then specify `UNLIMITED`.

Restriction on the QUOTA Clause

You cannot specify this clause for a temporary tablespace.

PROFILE Clause

Specify the profile you want to assign to the user. The profile limits the amount of database resources the user can use. If you omit this clause, then Oracle Database assigns the `DEFAULT` profile to the user.

You can use the `CREATE USER` statement to create a new user, and associate the user with a profile that has the `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` configured.

You must first set the password rollover period using `CREATE PROFILE` or `ALTER PROFILE`.

In the example `u1` is the user, with password `p1`. `prof1` is the profile with `PASSWORD_ROLLOVER_TIME` set.

```
CREATE USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY p1 PROFILE prof1 ;
```

Note:

Oracle recommends that you use the Database Resource Manager to establish database resource limits rather than SQL profiles. The Database Resource Manager offers a more flexible means of managing and tracking resource use. For more information on the Database Resource Manager, refer to [Oracle Database Administrator's Guide.](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf&id=ADMIN027)

PASSWORD EXPIRE Clause

Specify `PASSWORD` `EXPIRE` if you want the user's password to expire. This setting forces the user or the DBA to change the password before the user can log in to the database.

ACCOUNT Clause

Specify `ACCOUNT` `LOCK` to lock the user's account and disable access. Specify `ACCOUNT` `UNLOCK` to unlock the user's account and enable access to the account. The default is `ACCOUNT` `UNLOCK`.

ENABLE EDITIONS

This clause is not reversible. Specify `ENABLE` `EDITIONS` to allow the user to create multiple versions of editionable objects in this schema using editions. Editionable objects in schemas that are not editions-enabled cannot be editioned.

Note the following before enabling editions with `ALTER USER`:

* Enabling editions is not a live operation.
* When a database is upgraded from Release 11.2 to Release 12.1, users who were enabled for editions in the pre-upgrade database are enabled for editions in the post-upgrade database and the default schema object types are editionable in their schemas. The default schema object types are displayed by the static data dictionary view `DBA_EDITIONED_TYPES` . Users who were not enabled for editions in the pre-upgrade database are not enabled for editions in the post-upgrade database and no schema object types are editionable in their schemas.
* To see which users already have editions enabled, see the `EDITIONS_ENABLED` column of the static data dictionary view `DBA_USERS` or `USER_USERS` .

Restriction on Enabling Editions

The `FOR` clause is ignored when used with `ENABLE EDITIONS`. This only applies to the `CREATE USER` statement, not the `ALTER USER` statement.

You cannot enable editions for any schemas supplied by Oracle.

CONTAINER Clause

The `CONTAINER` clause applies when you are connected to a CDB. However, it is not necessary to specify the `CONTAINER` clause because its default values are the only allowed values.

* To create a common user, you must be connected to the root. You can optionally specify `CONTAINER` `=` `ALL`, which is the default when you are connected to the root.
* To create a local user, you must be connected to a PDB. You can optionally specify `CONTAINER` `=` `CURRENT`, which is the default when you are connected to a PDB.

While creating a common user, any default tablespace, temporary tablespace, or profile specified using the following clauses must exist in all the containers belonging to the CDB:

* `DEFAULT` `TABLESPACE`
* `TEMPORARY` `TABLESPACE`
* `QUOTA`
* `PROFILE`

If these objects do not exist in all the containers, the `CREATE` `USER` statement fails.

READ ONLY | READ WRITE

Use this clause to set `READ ONLY` access to a local PDB user.

With read-only access, the local PDB user is not permitted to execute any write operations on the PDB they connect to. The session operates as if the database is open in read-only mode.

Specify `READ WRITE` to set `READ WRITE` access to a local user.

You must have the `CREATE USER` privilege to execute this statement.

You can view the state of a local user in the `*_USERS` view.

Examples

All of the following examples use the `example` tablespace, which exists in the seed database and is accessible to the sample schemas.

Creating a Database User: Example

If you create a new user with `PASSWORD` `EXPIRE`, then the user's password must be changed before the user attempts to log in to the database. You can create the user `sidney` by issuing the following statement:

```
CREATE USER sidney 
    IDENTIFIED BY out_standing1 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE example 
    QUOTA 10M ON example 
    TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
    QUOTA 5M ON system 
    PROFILE app_user 
    PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```

The user `sidney` has the following characteristics:

* The password `out_standing1`
* Default tablespace `example`, with a quota of 10 megabytes
* Temporary tablespace `temp`
* Access to the tablespace `SYSTEM`, with a quota of 5 megabytes
* Limits on database resources defined by the profile `app_user` (which was created in "[Creating a Profile: Example](CREATE-PROFILE.md#GUID-ABC7AE4D-64A8-4EA9-857D-BEF7300B64C3__I2092094)")
* An expired password, which must be changed before `sidney` can log in to the database

Creating External Database Users: Examples

The following example creates an external user, who must be identified by an external source before accessing the database:

```
CREATE USER app_user1
   IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY
   DEFAULT TABLESPACE example
   QUOTA 5M ON example
   PROFILE app_user;
```

The user `app_user1` has the following additional characteristics:

* Default tablespace `example`
* Default temporary tablespace `example`
* 5M of space on the tablespace `example` and unlimited quota on the temporary tablespace of the database
* Limits on database resources defined by the `app_user` profile

To create another user accessible only by an operating system account, prefix the user name with the value of the initialization parameter `OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX`. For example, if this value is "`ops$`", then you can create the externally identified user `external_user` with the following statement:

```
CREATE USER ops$external_user
   IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY
   DEFAULT TABLESPACE example
   QUOTA 5M ON example
   PROFILE app_user;
```

Creating a Global Database User: Example

The following example creates a global user. When you create a global user, you can specify the X.509 name that identifies this user at the enterprise directory server:

```
CREATE USER global_user
   IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY AS 'CN=analyst, OU=division1, O=oracle, C=US'
   DEFAULT TABLESPACE example
   QUOTA 5M ON example;
```

Creating a Common User in a CDB

The following example creates a common user called c##`comm_user` in a CDB. Before you run this `CREATE USER` statement, ensure that the tablespaces `example` and `temp_tbs` exist in all of the containers in the CDB.

```
CREATE USER c##comm_user
   IDENTIFIED BY comm_pwd
   DEFAULT TABLESPACE example
   QUOTA 20M ON example
   TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp_tbs;
```

The user `comm_user` has the following additional characteristics:
