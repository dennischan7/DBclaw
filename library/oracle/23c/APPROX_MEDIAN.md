# Oracle 23c - APPROX_MEDIAN
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/APPROX_MEDIAN.html

Purpose

`APPROX_MEDIAN` is an approximate inverse distribution function that assumes a continuous distribution model. It takes a numeric or datetime value and returns an approximate middle value or an approximate interpolated value that would be the middle value once the values are sorted. Nulls are ignored in the calculation.

This function provides an alternative to the `MEDIAN` function, which returns the exact middle value or interpolated value. `APPROX_MEDIAN` processes large amounts of data significantly faster than `MEDIAN`, with negligible deviation from the exact result.

For `expr`, specify the expression for which the approximate median value is being calculated. The acceptable data types for `expr`, and the return value data type for this function, depend on the algorithm that you specify with the `DETERMINISTIC` clause.

DETERMINISTIC

This clause lets you specify the type of algorithm this function uses to calculate the approximate median value.

* If you specify `DETERMINISTIC`, then this function calculates a deterministic approximate median value. In this case, `expr` must evaluate to a numeric value, or to a value that can be implicitly converted to a numeric value. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of its argument.
* If you omit `DETERMINSTIC`, then this function calculates a nondeterministic approximate median value. In this case, `expr` must evaluate to a numeric or datetime value, or to a value that can be implicitly converted to a numeric or datetime value. The function returns the same data type as the numeric or datetime data type of its argument.

ERROR\_RATE | CONFIDENCE

These clauses let you determine the accuracy of the value calculated by this function. If you specify one of these clauses, then instead of returning the approximate median value for `expr`, the function returns a decimal value from 0 to 1, inclusive, which represents one of the following values:

* If you specify `ERROR_RATE`, then the return value represents the error rate for the approximate median value calculation for `expr`.
* If you specify `CONFIDENCE`, then the return value represents the confidence level for the error rate that is returned when you specify `ERROR_RATE`.

See Also:

* [MEDIAN](MEDIAN.md#GUID-DE15705A-AC18-4416-8487-B9E1D70CE01A)
* [APPROX\_PERCENTILE](APPROX_PERCENTILE.md#GUID-70D54091-EE2F-4283-A10B-1AB5A1242FE2) which returns, for a given percentile, the approximate value that corresponds to that percentile by way of interpolation. `APPROX_MEDIAN` is the specific case of `APPROX_PERCENTILE` where the percentile value is 0.5.

Examples

The following query returns the deterministic approximate median salary for each department in the `hr`.`employees` table:

```
SELECT department_id "Department",
       APPROX_MEDIAN(salary DETERMINISTIC) "Median Salary"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;
 
Department Median Salary
---------- -------------
        10          4400
        20          6000
        30          2765
        40          6500
        50          3100
        60          4800
        70         10000
        80          9003
        90         17000
       100          7739
       110          8300
                    7000
```

The following query returns the error rates for the approximate median salaries that were returned by the previous query:

```
SELECT department_id "Department",
       APPROX_MEDIAN(salary DETERMINISTIC, 'ERROR_RATE') "Error Rate"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;

Department Error Rate

        10 .002718282
        20 .021746255
        30 .021746255
        40 .002718282

       110 .019027973
           .002718282

The following query returns the confidence levels for the error rates that were returned by the previous query:

```
SELECT department_id "Department",
       APPROX_MEDIAN(salary DETERMINISTIC, 'CONFIDENCE') "Confidence Level"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;

Department Confidence Level

The following query returns the nondeterministic approximate median hire date for each department in the `hr`.`employees` table:

```
SELECT department_id "Department",
       APPROX_MEDIAN(hire_date) "Median Hire Date"
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  ORDER BY department_id;
