# Oracle 23c - CALL
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/CALL.html

Purpose

Use the `CALL` statement to execute a routine (a standalone procedure or function, or a procedure or function defined within a type or package) from within SQL.

Note:

The restrictions on user-defined function expressions specified in "[Function Expressions](Function-Expressions.md#GUID-C47F0B7D-9058-481F-815E-A31FB21F3BD5)" apply to the `CALL` statement as well.

Prerequisites

You must have `EXECUTE` privilege on the standalone routine or on the type or package in which the routine is defined.

object\_access\_expression::=

Semantics

You can execute a routine in two ways. You can issue a call to the routine itself by name, by using the `routine_clause`, or you can invoke a routine inside the type of an expression, by using an `object_access_expression`.

routine\_clause

Specify the name of the function or procedure being called, or a synonym that resolves to a function or procedure.

When you call a member function or procedure of a type, if the first argument (`SELF`) is a null `IN` `OUT` argument, then Oracle Database returns an error. If `SELF` is a null `IN` argument, then the database returns null. In both cases, the function or procedure is not invoked.

Restriction on Functions

If the routine is a function, then the `INTO` clause is required.

schema

Specify the schema in which the standalone routine, or the package or type containing the routine, resides. If you do not specify `schema`, then Oracle Database assumes the routine is in your own schema.

type or package

Specify the type or package in which the routine is defined.

@dblink

In a distributed database system, specify the name of the database containing the standalone routine, or the package or function containing the routine. If you omit `dblink`, then Oracle Database looks in your local database.

object\_access\_expression

If you have an expression of an object type, such as a type constructor or a bind variable, then you can use this form of expression to call a routine defined within the type. In this context, the `object_access_expression` is limited to method invocations.

argument

Specify one or more arguments to the routine, if the routine takes arguments. You can use positional, named, or mixed notation for `argument`. For example, all of the following notations are correct:

```
CALL my_procedure(arg1 => 3, arg2 => 4)
```

```
CALL my_procedure(3, 4) 

CALL my_procedure(3, arg2 => 4)
```

Restrictions on Applying Arguments to Routines

The `argument` is subject to the following restrictions:

* The data types of the parameters passed by the `CALL` statement must be SQL data types. They cannot be PL/SQL-only data types such as `BOOLEAN`.
* An `argument` cannot be a pseudocolumn or either of the object reference functions `VALUE` or `REF`.
* Any `argument` that is an `IN` `OUT` or `OUT` argument of the routine must correspond to a host variable expression.
* The number of arguments, including any return argument, is limited to 1000.
* You cannot bind arguments of character and raw data types (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `RAW`, `LONG` `RAW`) that are larger than 4K.

INTO :host\_variable

The `INTO` clause applies only to calls to functions. Specify which host variable will store the return value of the function.

:indicator\_variable

Specify the value or condition of the host variable.

Examples

Calling a Procedure: Example

The following statement removes the Entertainment department (created in "[Inserting Sequence Values: Example](INSERT.md#GUID-903F8043-0254-4EE9-ACC1-CB8AC0AF3423__I2102477)") using uses the `remove_dept` procedure. See [Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01381) for the example that creates this procedure.

```
CALL emp_mgmt.remove_dept(162);
```

Calling a Procedure Using an Expression of an Object Type: Example

The following examples show how call a procedure by using an expression of an object type in the `CALL` statement. The example uses the `warehouse_typ` object type in the order entry sample schema `OE`:

```
ALTER TYPE warehouse_typ
      ADD MEMBER FUNCTION ret_name
      RETURN VARCHAR2
      CASCADE;

CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE BODY warehouse_typ
      AS MEMBER FUNCTION ret_name
      RETURN VARCHAR2
      IS
         BEGIN
            RETURN self.warehouse_name;
         END;
      END;
/
VARIABLE x VARCHAR2(25);

CALL warehouse_typ(456, 'Warehouse 456', 2236).ret_name()
   INTO :x;

PRINT x;
X
--------------------------------
Warehouse 456
```

The next example shows how to use an external function to achieve the same thing:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ret_warehouse_typ(x warehouse_typ) 
  RETURN warehouse_typ
  IS
    BEGIN
      RETURN x;
    END;
/
CALL ret_warehouse_typ(warehouse_typ(234, 'Warehouse 234',
   2235)).ret_name()
   INTO :x;

PRINT x;

X
--------------------------------
Warehouse 234
```
