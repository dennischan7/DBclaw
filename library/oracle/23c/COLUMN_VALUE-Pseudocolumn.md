# Oracle 23c - COLUMN_VALUE-Pseudocolumn
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/COLUMN_VALUE-Pseudocolumn.html

When you refer to an `XMLTable` construct without the `COLUMNS` clause, or when you use the `TABLE` collection expression to refer to a scalar nested table type, the database returns a virtual table with a single column. This name of this pseudocolumn is `COLUMN_VALUE`.

In the context of `XMLTable`, the value returned is of data type `XMLType`. For example, the following two statements are equivalent, and the output for both shows `COLUMN_VALUE` as the name of the column being returned:

```
SELECT *
  FROM XMLTABLE('<a>123</a>');

COLUMN_VALUE
---------------------------------------
<a>123</a>

SELECT COLUMN_VALUE
  FROM (XMLTable('<a>123</a>'));

COLUMN_VALUE
----------------------------------------
<a>123</a>
```

In the context of a `TABLE` collection expression, the value returned is the data type of the collection element. The following statements create the two levels of nested tables illustrated in [Creating a Table: Multilevel Collection Example](CREATE-TABLE.md#GUID-F9CE0CC3-13AE-4744-A43C-EAC7A71AAAB6__I2139603) to show the uses of `COLUMN_VALUE` in this context:

```
CREATE TYPE phone AS TABLE OF NUMBER;   
/
CREATE TYPE phone_list AS TABLE OF phone;
/
```

The next statement uses `COLUMN_VALUE` to select from the `phone` type:

```
SELECT t.COLUMN_VALUE
  FROM TABLE(phone(1,2,3)) t;

COLUMN_VALUE
------------
           1
           2
           3
```

In a nested type, you can use the `COLUMN_VALUE` pseudocolumn in both the select list and the `TABLE` collection expression:

```
SELECT t.COLUMN_VALUE
  FROM TABLE(phone_list(phone(1,2,3))) p, TABLE(p.COLUMN_VALUE) t;

COLUMN_VALUE
------------
           1
           2
           3
```

The keyword `COLUMN_VALUE` is also the name that Oracle Database generates for the scalar value of an inner nested table without a column or attribute name, as shown in the example that follows. In this context, `COLUMN_VALUE` is not a pseudocolumn, but an actual column name.

```
CREATE TABLE my_customers (
    cust_id       NUMBER,
    name          VARCHAR2(25),
    phone_numbers phone_list,
    credit_limit  NUMBER)
  NESTED TABLE phone_numbers STORE AS outer_ntab
  (NESTED TABLE COLUMN_VALUE STORE AS inner_ntab);
```
