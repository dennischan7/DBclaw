# NVL2

Syntax

Purpose

`NVL2` lets you determine the value returned by a query based on whether a specified expression is null or not null. If `expr1` is not null, then `NVL2` returns `expr2`. If `expr1` is null, then `NVL2` returns `expr3`.

The argument `expr1` can have any data type. The arguments `expr2` and `expr3` can have any data types except `LONG`.

If the data types of `expr2` and `expr3` are different, then Oracle Database implicitly converts one to the other. If they cannot be converted implicitly, then the database returns an error. If `expr2` is character or numeric data, then the implicit conversion is implemented as follows:

* If `expr2` is character data, then Oracle Database converts `expr3` to the data type of `expr2` before returning a value unless `expr3` is a null constant. In that case, a data type conversion is not necessary, and the database returns `VARCHAR2` in the character set of `expr2`.
* If `expr2` is numeric data, then Oracle Database determines which argument has the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the other argument to that data type, and returns that data type.

Examples

The following example shows whether the income of some employees is made up of salary plus commission, or just salary, depending on whether the `commission_pct` column of `employees` is null or not.

```
SELECT last_name, salary,
       NVL2(commission_pct, salary + (salary * commission_pct), salary) income
  FROM employees
  WHERE last_name like 'B%'
  ORDER BY last_name;

LAST_NAME                     SALARY     INCOME
