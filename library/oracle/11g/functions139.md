# PRESENTV

Syntax

Purpose

The `PRESENTV` function can be used only within the `model_clause` of the `SELECT` statement and then only on the right-hand side of a model rule. It returns `expr1` when, prior to the execution of the `model_clause`, `cell_reference` exists. Otherwise it returns `expr2`.

Examples

In the following example, if a row containing sales for the Mouse Pad for the year 2000 exists, then the sales value for the Mouse Pad for the year 2001 is set to the sales value for the Mouse Pad for the year 2000. If the row does not exist, then a row is created with the sales value for the Mouse Pad for year 20001 set to 0.
