# ITERATION\_NUMBER

Syntax

Purpose

The `ITERATION_NUMBER` function can be used only in the `model_clause` of the `SELECT` statement and then only when `ITERATE(``number``)` is specified in the `model_rules_clause`. It returns an integer representing the completed iteration through the model rules. The `ITERATION_NUMBER` function returns 0 during the first iteration. For each subsequent iteration, the `ITERATION_NUMBER` function returns the equivalent of `iteration_number` plus one.

Examples

The following example assigns the sales of the Mouse Pad for the years 1998 and 1999 to the sales of the Mouse Pad for the years 2001 and 2002 respectively:

```
SELECT country, prod, year, s
  FROM sales_view_ref
  MODEL
    PARTITION BY (country)
    DIMENSION BY (prod, year)
    MEASURES (sale s)
    IGNORE NAV
    UNIQUE DIMENSION
    RULES UPSERT SEQUENTIAL ORDER ITERATE(2)
      (
        s['Mouse Pad', 2001 + ITERATION_NUMBER] =
          s['Mouse Pad', 1998 + ITERATION_NUMBER]
      )
  ORDER BY country, prod, year;
