To refer to the current or next value of a sequence in the schema of another user, you must have been granted either `SELECT` object privilege on the sequence or `SELECT` `ANY` `SEQUENCE` system privilege, and you must qualify the sequence with the schema containing it:

To refer to the value of a sequence on a remote database, you must qualify the sequence with a complete or partial name of a database link:

A sequence can be accessed by many users concurrently with no waiting or locking.

## Where to Use Sequence Values

You can use `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL` in the following locations:

* The select list of a `SELECT` statement that is not contained in a subquery, materialized view, or view
* The select list of a subquery in an `INSERT` statement
* The `VALUES` clause of an `INSERT` statement
* The `SET` clause of an `UPDATE` statement

Restrictions on Sequence Values You cannot use `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL` in the following constructs:

* A subquery in a `DELETE`, `SELECT`, or `UPDATE` statement
* A query of a view or of a materialized view
* A `SELECT` statement with the `DISTINCT` operator
* A `SELECT` statement with a `GROUP` `BY` clause or `ORDER` `BY` clause
* A `SELECT` statement that is combined with another `SELECT` statement with the `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `MINUS` set operator
* The `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement
* The `DEFAULT` value of a column in a `CREATE` `TABLE` or `ALTER` `TABLE` statement
* The condition of a `CHECK` constraint

Within a single SQL statement that uses `CURRVAL` or `NEXTVAL`, all referenced `LONG` columns, updated tables, and locked tables must be located on the same database.

## How to Use Sequence Values

When you create a sequence, you can define its initial value and the increment between its values. The first reference to `NEXTVAL` returns the initial value of the sequence. Subsequent references to `NEXTVAL` increment the sequence value by the defined increment and return the new value. Any reference to `CURRVAL` always returns the current value of the sequence, which is the value returned by the last reference to `NEXTVAL`.

Before you use `CURRVAL` for a sequence in your session, you must first initialize the sequence with `NEXTVAL`. Refer to [CREATE SEQUENCE](statements_6015.md#i2067093) for information on sequences.

Within a single SQL statement containing a reference to `NEXTVAL`, Oracle increments the sequence once:

* For each row returned by the outer query block of a `SELECT` statement. Such a query block can appear in the following places:

  + A top-level `SELECT` statement
  + An `INSERT` ... `SELECT` statement (either single-table or multitable). For a multitable insert, the reference to `NEXTVAL` must appear in the `VALUES` clause, and the sequence is updated once for each row returned by the subquery, even though `NEXTVAL` may be referenced in multiple branches of the multitable insert.
  + A `CREATE` `TABLE` ... `AS` `SELECT` statement
  + A `CREATE` `MATERIALIZED` `VIEW` ... `AS` `SELECT` statement
* For each row updated in an `UPDATE` statement
* For each `INSERT` statement containing a `VALUES` clause
* For each `INSERT` ... [`ALL` | `FIRST`] statement (multitable insert). A multitable insert is considered a single SQL statement. Therefore, a reference to the `NEXTVAL` of a sequence will increase the sequence only once for each input record coming from the `SELECT` portion of the statement. If `NEXTVAL` is specified more than once in any part of the `INSERT` ... [`ALL` | `FIRST` ] statement, then the value will be the same for all insert branches, regardless of how often a given record might be inserted.
* For each row merged by a `MERGE` statement. The reference to `NEXTVAL` can appear in the `merge_insert_clause` or the `merge_update_clause` or both. The `NEXTVALUE` value is incremented for each row updated and for each row inserted, even if the sequence number is not actually used in the update or insert operation. If `NEXTVAL` is specified more than once in any of these locations, then the sequence is incremented once for each row and returns the same value for all occurrences of `NEXTVAL` for that row.
* For each input row in a multitable `INSERT` `ALL` statement. `NEXTVAL` is incremented once for each row returned by the subquery, regardless of how many occurrences of the `insert_into_clause` map to each row.

If any of these locations contains more than one reference to `NEXTVAL`, then Oracle increments the sequence once and returns the same value for all occurrences of `NEXTVAL`.

If any of these locations contains references to both `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`, then Oracle increments the sequence and returns the same value for both `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`.

Finding the next value of a sequence: Example This example selects the next value of the employee sequence in the sample schema `hr`:

```
SELECT employees_seq.nextval 
  FROM DUAL;
```

Inserting sequence values into a table: Example This example increments the employee sequence and uses its value for a new employee inserted into the sample table `hr.employees`:

```
INSERT INTO employees
  VALUES (employees_seq.nextval, 'John', 'Doe', 'jdoe', '555-1212',
          TO_DATE(SYSDATE), 'PU_CLERK', 2500, null, null, 30);
```

Reusing the current value of a sequence: Example This example adds a new order with the next order number to the master order table. It then adds suborders with this number to the detail order table:

```
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id)
  VALUES (orders_seq.nextval, TO_DATE(SYSDATE), 106);

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, line_item_id, product_id)
  VALUES (orders_seq.currval, 1, 2359);

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, line_item_id, product_id)
  VALUES (orders_seq.currval, 2, 3290);

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, line_item_id, product_id)
  VALUES (orders_seq.currval, 3, 2381);
```
