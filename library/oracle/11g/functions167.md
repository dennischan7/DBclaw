# SOUNDEX

Syntax

Purpose

`SOUNDEX` returns a character string containing the phonetic representation of `char`. This function lets you compare words that are spelled differently, but sound alike in English.

The phonetic representation is defined in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching, by Donald E. Knuth, as follows:

1. Retain the first letter of the string and remove all other occurrences of the following letters: a, e, h, i, o, u, w, y.
2. Assign numbers to the remaining letters (after the first) as follows:

   ```
   b, f, p, v = 1
   c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z = 2
   d, t = 3
   l = 4
   m, n = 5
   r = 6
   ```
3. If two or more letters with the same number were adjacent in the original name (before step 1), or adjacent except for any intervening h and w, then retain the first letter and omit rest of all the adjacent letters with same number.
4. Return the first four bytes padded with 0.

`char` can be of any of the data types `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. The return value is the same data type as `char`.

This function does not support `CLOB` data directly. However, `CLOB`s can be passed in as arguments through implicit data conversion.

Examples

The following example returns the employees whose last names are a phonetic representation of "Smyth":

```
SELECT last_name, first_name
     FROM hr.employees
     WHERE SOUNDEX(last_name)
         = SOUNDEX('SMYTHE')
     ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

LAST_NAME  FIRST_NAME
---------- ----------
Smith      Lindsey
Smith      William
```
