# IN Condition

An `in_condition` is a membership condition. It tests a value for membership in a list of values or subquery

in\_condition::=

expression\_list::=

If you use the upper form of the `in_condition` condition (with a single expression to the left of the operator), then you must use the upper form of `expression_list`. If you use the lower form of this condition (with multiple expressions to the left of the operator), then you must use the lower form of `expression_list`, and the expressions in each `expression_list` must match in number and data type the expressions to the left of the operator. You can specify up to 1000 expressions in `expression_list`.

Oracle Database does not always evaluate the expressions in an `expression_list` in the order in which they appear in the `IN` list. However, expressions in the select list of a subquery are evaluated in their specified order.

[Table 7-12](#CJAFFIIG) lists the form of `IN` condition.

Table 7-12 IN Condition

| Type of Condition | Operation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``` IN ``` | Equal-to-any-member-of test. Equivalent to `=ANY`. | ``` SELECT * FROM employees   WHERE job_id IN   ('PU_CLERK','SH_CLERK')   ORDER BY employee_id; SELECT * FROM employees   WHERE salary IN   (SELECT salary     FROM employees    WHERE department_id =30)   ORDER BY employee_id; ``` |
| ``` NOT IN ``` | Equivalent to !=`ALL`. Evaluates to `FALSE` if any member of the set is `NULL`. | ``` SELECT * FROM employees   WHERE salary NOT IN   (SELECT salary     FROM employees   WHERE department_id = 30)   ORDER BY employee_id; SELECT * FROM employees   WHERE job_id NOT IN   ('PU_CLERK', 'SH_CLERK')   ORDER BY employee_id; ``` |

If any item in the list following a `NOT` `IN` operation evaluates to null, then all rows evaluate to `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`, and no rows are returned. For example, the following statement returns the string '`True`' for each row:

```
SELECT 'True' FROM employees
   WHERE department_id NOT IN (10, 20);
```

However, the following statement returns no rows:

```
SELECT 'True' FROM employees
    WHERE department_id NOT IN (10, 20, NULL);
```

The preceding example returns no rows because the `WHERE` clause condition evaluates to:

```
department_id != 10 AND department_id != 20 AND department_id != null
```

Because the third condition compares `department_id` with a null, it results in an `UNKNOWN`, so the entire expression results in `FALSE` (for rows with `department_id` equal to 10 or 20). This behavior can easily be overlooked, especially when the `NOT` `IN` operator references a subquery.

Moreover, if a `NOT` `IN` condition references a subquery that returns no rows at all, then all rows will be returned, as shown in the following example:

```
SELECT 'True' FROM employees
   WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT 0 FROM DUAL WHERE 1=2);
```

Restriction on LEVEL in WHERE Clauses In a [`NOT`] `IN` condition in a `WHERE` clause, if the right-hand side of the condition is a subquery, you cannot use `LEVEL` on the left-hand side of the condition. However, you can specify `LEVEL` in a subquery of the `FROM` clause to achieve the same result. For example, the following statement is not valid:

```
SELECT employee_id, last_name FROM employees
   WHERE (employee_id, LEVEL) 
      IN (SELECT employee_id, 2 FROM employees)
   START WITH employee_id = 2
   CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```

But the following statement is valid because it encapsulates the query containing the `LEVEL` information in the `FROM` clause:

```
SELECT v.employee_id, v.last_name, v.lev FROM
      (SELECT employee_id, last_name, LEVEL lev 
      FROM employees v
      START WITH employee_id = 100 
      CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id) v 
   WHERE (v.employee_id, v.lev) IN
      (SELECT employee_id, 2 FROM employees);
```
