# WIDTH\_BUCKET

Syntax

Purpose

`WIDTH_BUCKET` lets you construct equiwidth histograms, in which the histogram range is divided into intervals that have identical size. (Compare this function with `NTILE`, which creates equiheight histograms.) Ideally each bucket is a closed-open interval of the real number line. For example, a bucket can be assigned to scores between 10.00 and 19.999 ... to indicate that 10 is included in the interval and 20 is excluded. This is sometimes denoted [10, 20).

For a given expression, `WIDTH_BUCKET` returns the bucket number into which the value of this expression would fall after being evaluated.

* `expr` is the expression for which the histogram is being created. This expression must evaluate to a numeric or datetime value or to a value that can be implicitly converted to a numeric or datetime value. If `expr` evaluates to null, then the expression returns null.
* `min_value` and `max_value` are expressions that resolve to the end points of the acceptable range for `expr`. Both of these expressions must also evaluate to numeric or datetime values, and neither can evaluate to null.
* `num_buckets` is an expression that resolves to a constant indicating the number of buckets. This expression must evaluate to a positive integer.

When needed, Oracle Database creates an underflow bucket numbered 0 and an overflow bucket numbered `num_buckets`+1. These buckets handle values less than `min_value` and more than `max_value` and are helpful in checking the reasonableness of endpoints.

Examples

The following example creates a ten-bucket histogram on the `credit_limit` column for customers in Switzerland in the sample table `oe.customers` and returns the bucket number ("Credit Group") for each customer. Customers with credit limits greater than or equal to the maximum value are assigned to the overflow bucket, 11:

```
SELECT customer_id, cust_last_name, credit_limit, 
   WIDTH_BUCKET(credit_limit, 100, 5000, 10) "Credit Group"
   FROM customers WHERE nls_territory = 'SWITZERLAND'
   ORDER BY "Credit Group", customer_id, cust_last_name, credit_limit;

CUSTOMER_ID CUST_LAST_NAME       CREDIT_LIMIT Credit Group
