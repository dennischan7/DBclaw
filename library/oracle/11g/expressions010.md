# Model Expressions

A model expression is used only in the `model_clause` of a `SELECT` statement and then only on the right-hand side of a model rule. It yields a value for a cell in a measure column previously defined in the `model_clause`. For additional information, refer to [model\_clause](statements_10002.md#i2172805) .

model\_expression::=

When you specify a measure column in a model expression, any conditions and expressions you specify must resolve to single values.

When you specify an aggregate function in a model expression, the argument to the function is a measure column that has been previously defined in the `model_clause`. An aggregate function can be used only on the right-hand side of a model rule.

Specifying an analytic function on the right-hand side of the model rule lets you express complex calculations directly in the `model_clause`. The following restrictions apply when using an analytic function in a model expression:

* Analytic functions can be used only in an `UPDATE` rule.
* You cannot specify an analytic function on the right-hand side of the model rule if the left-hand side of the rule contains a `FOR` loop or an `ORDER` `BY` clause.
* The arguments in the `OVER` clause of the analytic function cannot contain an aggregate.
* The arguments before the `OVER` clause of the analytic function cannot contain a cell reference.

When `expr` is itself a model expression, it is referred to as a nested cell reference. The following restrictions apply to nested cell references:

* Only one level of nesting is allowed.
* A nested cell reference must be a single-cell reference.
* When `AUTOMATIC` `ORDER` is specified in the `model_rules_clause`, a nested cell reference can be used on the left-hand side of a model rule only if the measures used in the nested cell reference remain static.

The model expressions shown below are based on the `model_clause` of the following `SELECT` statement:

```
SELECT country,prod,year,s
  FROM sales_view_ref
  MODEL
    PARTITION BY (country)
    DIMENSION BY (prod, year)
    MEASURES (sale s)
    IGNORE NAV
    UNIQUE DIMENSION
    RULES UPSERT SEQUENTIAL ORDER
    (
      s[prod='Mouse Pad', year=2000] =
        s['Mouse Pad', 1998] + s['Mouse Pad', 1999],
      s['Standard Mouse', 2001] = s['Standard Mouse', 2000]
    )
  ORDER BY country, prod, year;
```

The following model expression represents a single cell reference using symbolic notation. It represents the sales of the Mouse Pad for the year 2000.

```
s[prod='Mouse Pad',year=2000]
```

The following model expression represents a multiple cell reference using positional notation, using the `CV` function. It represents the sales of the current value of the dimension column `prod` for the year 2001.

```
s[CV(prod), 2001]
```

The following model expression represents an aggregate function. It represents the sum of sales of the Mouse Pad for the years between the current value of the dimension column `year` less two and the current value of the dimension column `year` less one.

```
SUM(s)['Mouse Pad',year BETWEEN CV()-2 AND CV()-1]
```
