# XMLPI

Syntax

Purpose

`XMLPI` generates an XML processing instruction using `identifier` and optionally the evaluated result of `value_expr`. A processing instruction is commonly used to provide to an application information that is associated with all or part of an XML document. The application uses the processing instruction to determine how best to process the XML document.

You must specify a value for Oracle Database to use an the enclosing tag. You can do this by specifying `identifier`, which is a string literal, or by specifying `EVALNAME` `value_expr`. In the latter case, the value expression is evaluated and the result, which must be a string literal, is used as the identifier. The identifier can be up to 4000 characters and does not have to be a column name or column reference. It cannot be an expression or null.

The optional `value_expr` must resolve to a string. If you omit the optional `value_expr`, then a zero-length string is the default. The value returned by the function takes this form:

```
<?identifier string?>
```

`XMLPI` is subject to the following restrictions:

* The `identifier` must be a valid target for a processing instruction.
* You cannot specify `xml` in any case combination for `identifier`.
* The `identifier` cannot contain the consecutive characters `?>`.

Examples

The following statement uses the `DUAL` table to illustrate the use of the `XMLPI` syntax:

```
SELECT XMLPI(NAME "Order analysisComp", 'imported, reconfigured, disassembled')
   AS "XMLPI" FROM DUAL;
 
XMLPI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?Order analysisComp imported, reconfigured, disassembled?>
```
