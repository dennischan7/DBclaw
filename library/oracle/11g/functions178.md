# STDDEV

Syntax

Purpose

`STDDEV` returns the sample standard deviation of `expr`, a set of numbers. You can use it as both an aggregate and analytic function. It differs from `STDDEV_SAMP` in that `STDDEV` returns zero when it has only 1 row of input data, whereas `STDDEV_SAMP` returns null.

Oracle Database calculates the standard deviation as the square root of the variance defined for the `VARIANCE` aggregate function.

This function takes as an argument any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. The function returns the same data type as the numeric data type of the argument.

If you specify `DISTINCT`, then you can specify only the `query_partition_clause` of the `analytic_clause`. The `order_by_clause` and `windowing_clause` are not allowed.

Aggregate Examples

The following example returns the standard deviation of the salaries in the sample `hr.employees` table:

```
SELECT STDDEV(salary) "Deviation"
   FROM employees;
 
 Deviation
----------
3909.36575
```

Analytic Examples

The query in the following example returns the cumulative standard deviation of the salaries in Department 80 in the sample table `hr.employees`, ordered by `hire_date`:

```
SELECT last_name, salary, 
   STDDEV(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) "StdDev"
   FROM employees  
   WHERE department_id = 30
   ORDER BY last_name, salary, "StdDev"; 
 
LAST_NAME                     SALARY     StdDev
