# LAG

Syntax

See Also:

["Analytic Functions"](functions004.md#i81407)

for information on syntax, semantics, and restrictions, including valid forms of

`value_expr`

Purpose

`LAG` is an analytic function. It provides access to more than one row of a table at the same time without a self join. Given a series of rows returned from a query and a position of the cursor, `LAG` provides access to a row at a given physical offset prior to that position.

For the optional `offset` argument, specify an integer that is greater than zero. If you do not specify `offset`, then its default is 1. The optional `default` value is returned if the offset goes beyond the scope of the window. If you do not specify `default`, then its default is null.

{`RESPECT` | `IGNORE`} `NULLS` determines whether null values of `value_expr` are included in or eliminated from the calculation. The default is `RESPECT` `NULLS`.

You cannot nest analytic functions by using `LAG` or any other analytic function for `value_expr`. However, you can use other built-in function expressions for `value_expr`.

Examples

The following example provides, for each purchasing clerk in the `employees` table, the salary of the employee hired just before:

```
SELECT hire_date, last_name, salary,
       LAG(salary, 1, 0 ) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS prev_sal
  FROM employees
  WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK'
  ORDER BY hire_date;
   
HIRE_DATE LAST_NAME                     SALARY   PREV_SAL
