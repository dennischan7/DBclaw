# CORR

Syntax

Purpose

`CORR` returns the coefficient of correlation of a set of number pairs. You can use it as an aggregate or analytic function.

This function takes as arguments any numeric data type or any nonnumeric data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric data type. Oracle determines the argument with the highest numeric precedence, implicitly converts the remaining arguments to that data type, and returns that data type.

Oracle Database applies the function to the set of (`expr1`, `expr2`) after eliminating the pairs for which either `expr1` or `expr2` is null. Then Oracle makes the following computation:

```
COVAR_POP(expr1, expr2) / (STDDEV_POP(expr1) * STDDEV_POP(expr2))
```

The function returns a value of type `NUMBER`. If the function is applied to an empty set, then it returns null.

Note:

The

`CORR`

function calculates the Pearson's correlation coefficient, which requires numeric expressions as arguments. Oracle also provides the

`CORR_S`

(Spearman's rho coefficient) and

`CORR_K`

(Kendall's tau-b coefficient) functions to support nonparametric or rank correlation.

Aggregate Example

The following example calculates the coefficient of correlation between the list prices and minimum prices of products by weight class in the sample table `oe.product_information`:

```
SELECT weight_class, CORR(list_price, min_price) "Correlation"
  FROM product_information
  GROUP BY weight_class
  ORDER BY weight_class, "Correlation";

WEIGHT_CLASS Correlation
------------ -----------
           1  .999149795
           2  .999022941
           3  .998484472
           4  .999359909
           5  .999536087
```

Analytic Example

The following example shows the correlation between duration at the company and salary by the employee's position. The result set shows the same correlation for each employee in a given job:

```
SELECT employee_id, job_id, 
       TO_CHAR((SYSDATE - hire_date) YEAR TO MONTH ) "Yrs-Mns",     salary, 
       CORR(SYSDATE-hire_date, salary)
       OVER(PARTITION BY job_id) AS "Correlation"
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id in (50, 80)
  ORDER BY job_id, employee_id;

EMPLOYEE_ID JOB_ID     Yrs-Mns     SALARY Correlation
