# GROUPING\_ID

Syntax

Purpose

`GROUPING_ID` returns a number corresponding to the `GROUPING` bit vector associated with a row. `GROUPING_ID` is applicable only in a `SELECT` statement that contains a `GROUP` `BY` extension, such as `ROLLUP` or `CUBE`, and a `GROUPING` function. In queries with many `GROUP` `BY` expressions, determining the `GROUP` `BY` level of a particular row requires many `GROUPING` functions, which leads to cumbersome SQL. `GROUPING_ID` is useful in these cases.

`GROUPING_ID` is functionally equivalent to taking the results of multiple `GROUPING` functions and concatenating them into a bit vector (a string of ones and zeros). By using `GROUPING_ID` you can avoid the need for multiple `GROUPING` functions and make row filtering conditions easier to express. Row filtering is easier with `GROUPING_ID` because the desired rows can be identified with a single condition of `GROUPING_ID` = `n`. The function is especially useful when storing multiple levels of aggregation in a single table.

Examples

The following example shows how to extract grouping IDs from a query of the sample table `sh.sales`:

```
SELECT channel_id, promo_id, sum(amount_sold) s_sales,
       GROUPING(channel_id) gc,
       GROUPING(promo_id) gp,
       GROUPING_ID(channel_id, promo_id) gcp,
       GROUPING_ID(promo_id, channel_id) gpc
  FROM sales
  WHERE promo_id > 496
  GROUP BY CUBE(channel_id, promo_id)
  ORDER BY channel_id, promo_id, s_sales, gc;
 
CHANNEL_ID   PROMO_ID    S_SALES         GC         GP        GCP        GPC
