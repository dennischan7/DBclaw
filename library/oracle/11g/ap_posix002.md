# Regular Expression Operator Multilingual Enhancements

When applied to multilingual data, Oracle's implementation of the POSIX operators extends beyond the matching capabilities specified in the POSIX standard. [Table D-2](#g692318) shows the relationship of the operators in the context of the POSIX standard.

* The first column lists the supported operators.
* The second and third columns indicate whether the POSIX standard (Basic Regular Expression—BRE and Extended Regular Expression—ERE, respectively) defines the operator
* The fourth column indicates whether Oracle's implementation extends the operator's semantics for handling multilingual data.

Oracle lets you enter multibyte characters directly, if you have a direct input method, or you can use functions to compose the multibyte characters. You cannot use the Unicode hexadecimal encoding value of the form '`\xxxx`'. Oracle evaluates the characters based on the byte values used to encode the character, not the graphical representation of the character. All accented characters are considered word characters.
