# Oracle 21c - CHR
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/CHR.html

`CHR` returns the character having the binary equivalent to `n` as a `VARCHAR2` value in either the database character set or, if you specify `USING` `NCHAR_CS`, the national character set.

For single-byte character sets, if `n` > 256, then Oracle Database returns the binary equivalent of `n` `mod` `256`. For multibyte character sets, `n` must resolve to one entire code point. Invalid code points are not validated, and the result of specifying invalid code points is indeterminate.

This function takes as an argument a `NUMBER` value, or any value that can be implicitly converted to `NUMBER`, and returns a character.

Note:

Use of the `CHR` function (either with or without the optional `USING` `NCHAR_CS` clause) results in code that is not portable between ASCII- and EBCDIC-based machine architectures.

The following example is run on an ASCII-based machine with the database character set defined as WE8ISO8859P1:

```
SELECT CHR(67)||CHR(65)||CHR(84) "Dog"
  FROM DUAL;

Dog
---
CAT
```

To produce the same results on an EBCDIC-based machine with the WE8EBCDIC1047 character set, the preceding example would have to be modified as follows:

```
SELECT CHR(195)||CHR(193)||CHR(227) "Dog"
  FROM DUAL; 

Dog 
--- 
CAT
```

For multibyte character sets, this sort of concatenation gives different results. For example, given a multibyte character whose hexadecimal value is `a1a2` (`a1` representing the first byte and `a2` the second byte), you must specify for `n` the decimal equivalent of '`a1a2`', or 41378:

```
SELECT CHR(41378)
  FROM DUAL;
```

You cannot specify the decimal equivalent of a1 concatenated with the decimal equivalent of a2, as in the following example:

```
SELECT CHR(161)||CHR(162)
  FROM DUAL;
```

However, you can concatenate whole multibyte code points, as in the following example, which concatenates the multibyte characters whose hexadecimal values are `a1a2` and `a1a3`:

```
SELECT CHR(41378)||CHR(41379)
  FROM DUAL;
```

The following example assumes that the national character set is UTF16:

```
SELECT CHR (196 USING NCHAR_CS)
  FROM DUAL; 

CH 
-- 
Ã
```
