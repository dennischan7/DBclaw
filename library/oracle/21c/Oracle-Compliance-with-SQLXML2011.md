| X010, XML type | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X011, Arrays of XML types | Oracle supports this feature using named array types |
| X012, Multisets of XML type | The Oracle equivalent of a multiset of XML type is a nested table with a single column of XML type. |
| X013, Distinct types of XML | A distinct type can be emulated using an object type with a single attribute. |
| X014, Attributes of XML type | In Oracle, attributes of object types may be of type `XMLType`, but the syntax for creating object types is nonstandard. |
| X015, Fields of XML type | Oracle object types may be used instead of row types; Oracle supports object types with attributes of `XMLType`. |
| X016, Persistent XML values | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X020, `XMLConcat` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X025, `XMLCast` | Oracle supports this feature, with the following restrictions:   * The source expression must be of `XMLType` and the target data type may not be `XMLType`. (Since Oracle has only one XML type, there is no need to cast from XML to XML.) * Oracle does not support <XML passing mechanism>; the behavior is the same as `BY` `VALUE` in the standard.   Oracle extends this feature with the ability to cast to type `REF` `XMLTYPE`. |
| X031, `XMLElement` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X032, `XMLForest` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X034, `XMLAgg` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X035, `XMLAgg`: `ORDER` `BY` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X036, `XMLComment` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X036, `XMLPi` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X038, `XMLText` | The Oracle `XMLCData` function may be used to create a text node. |
| X040, Basic table mapping | Oracle table mappings are available through a Java interface and through a package. Oracle table mappings have been generalized to map queries and not just tables. To map only a table: `SELECT` `*` `FROM` `table_name`. This provides support for the following elements of this feature:   * X041, Basic table mapping: null absent * X042, Basic table mapping: null as nil * X043, Basic table mapping: table as forest * X044, Basic table mapping: table as element * X045, Basic table mapping: with target namespace * X046, Basic table mapping: data mapping * X047, Basic table mapping: metadata mapping * X049, Basic table mapping: hex encoding   Oracle does not support the following element of this feature: |
| X041, Basic table mapping: null absent | See X040. |
| X042, Basic table mapping: null as nil | See X040. |
| X043, Basic table mapping: table as forest | See X040. |
| X044, Basic table mapping: table as element | See X040. |
| X045, Basic table mapping: with target namespace | See X040. |
| X046, Basic table mapping: data mapping | See X040. |
| X047, Basic table mapping: metadata mapping | See X040. |
| X049, Basic table mapping: hex encoding | See X040. |
| X060, `XMLParse`: Character string input and `CONTENT` option | Oracle does not support the {`PRESERVE` | `STRIP`} `WHITESPACE` syntax. The behavior is always `STRIP` `WHITESPACE`. |
| X061, `XMLParse`: Character string input and `DOCUMENT` option | Oracle does not support the {`PRESERVE` | `STRIP`} `WHITESPACE` syntax. The behavior is always `STRIP` `WHITESPACE`. |
| X069, `XMLSERIALIZE`: `INDENT` | Oracle extends this feature with the ability to specify an indent size. |
| X070, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization and `CONTENT` option | Oracle supports this feature, with this restriction:  Oracle extends this feature as follows: the standard requires a target data type; Oracle defaults to `CLOB`. |
| X071, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization and `DOCUMENT` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X072, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X073, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization and `CONTENT` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X074, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization and `DOCUMENT` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X075, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X076, `XMLSerialize`: `VERSION` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X077, `XMLSerialize`: explicit `ENCODING` option | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X080, Namespaces in XML publishing | In the Oracle implementation of `XMLElement`, `XMLAttributes` are used to define namespaces (`XMLNamespaces` is not implemented). However, `XMLAttributes` is not supported for `XMLForest`. |
| X086, XML namespace declarations in `XMLTable` | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X090, XML document predicate | In Oracle, you can test whether an XML value is a document by using the `ISFRAGMENT` method. |
| X096, `XMLExists` | Oracle fully supports this feature, with this exception: Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on individual arguments. |
| X120, XML parameters in SQL routines | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X121, XML parameters in external routines | Oracle supports XML values passed to external routines using a non-standard interface. |
| X141, `IS` `VALID` predicate: data drive case | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and supports the data-driven case. |
| X142, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `ACCORDING` `TO` clause | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and includes the equivalent of the `ACCORDING` `TO` clause. |
| X143, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `ELEMENT` clause | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and includes the equivalent of the `ELEMENT` clause. |
| X144, `IS` `VALID` predicate: schema location | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and supports the specification of a schema location for a registered XML Schema. |
| X145, `IS` `VALID` predicate outside check constraints | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used outside check constraints. |
| X151, `IS` `VALID` predicate with `DOCUMENT` option | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and performs validation equivalent to the `DOCUMENT` clause. (`XMLISVALID` does not support "content" validation.) |
| X156, `IS` `VALID` predicate: optional `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used to validate against an element in any namespace. |
| X157, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause | The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used to validate against an element in the "no name" namespace. |
| X160, Basic Information Schema for registered XML Schemas | The Oracle static data dictionary view `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS` provides a list of the registered XML schemas that are accessible to the current user. The `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA_URL` column corresponds to the standard `XML_SCHEMAS`.`XML_SCHEMA_LOCATION` column. The target namespace of the registered XML Schemas can be learned by examining `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA`. Oracle has no equivalents for the other columns of the standard's `XML_SCHEMAS`. |
| X161, Advanced Information Schema for registered XML Schemas | Oracle does not have static data dictionary views corresponding to `XML_SCHEMA_NAMESPACES` and `XML_SCHEMA_ELEMENTS` in the standard. However, all the information about registered XML Schemas may be learned by examining the actual XML Schema, which is found in the `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA` column. This may also be examined to learn whether a registered XML Schema is nondeterministic, and which of its namespaces and elements are nondeterministic. |
| X191, `XML`(`DOCUMENT` (`XMLSCHEMA`)) type | Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table can be constrained by a registered XML Schema, in which case all values of the column will be of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`XMLSCHEMA`)) type. |
| X200, `XMLQuery` | Oracle fully supports the following elements of this feature:   * X201, `XMLQuery`: `RETURNING` `CONTENT` * X203, `XMLQuery`: passing a context item * X204, `XMLQuery`: initializing an XQuery variable * X206, `XMLQuery`: `NULL` `ON` `EMPTY` option   Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on individual arguments. |
| X201, `XMLQuery`: `RETURNING` `CONTENT` | See X200. |
| X203, `XMLQuery`: passing a context item | See X200. |
| X204, `XMLQuery`: initializing an XQuery variable | See X200. |
| X206, `XMLQuery`: `NULL` `ON` `EMPTY` option | See X200. |
| X221, XML passing mechanism `BY` `VALUE` | Oracle supports the `BY` `VALUE` clause in `XMLQuery`, `XMLTable` and `XMLExists`. In these, `BY` `VALUE` is supported as optional syntax at the beginning of an argument list, but not as a modifier on an individual argument or column. |
| X232, `XML`(`CONTENT`(`ANY`)) type | Oracle does not support this syntax as a type modifier, but the Oracle `XMLType` supports this data type for transient values. Persistent values are of type `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`ANY`)), which is a subset of `XML`(`CONTENT`(`ANY`)). |
| X241, `RETURNING` `CONTENT` in XML publishing | Oracle does not support this syntax. In Oracle, the behavior of the publishing functions (`XMLAgg`, `XMLComment`, `XMLConcat`, `XMLElement`, `XMLForest`, and `XMLPi`) is always `RETURNING` `CONTENT`. |
| X251, Persistent XML values of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`UNTYPED`)) type | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X252, Persistent values of type `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`ANY`)) | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X256, Persistent values of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`XMLSCHEMA`)) type | Oracle fully supports this feature. |
| X260, XML type, `ELEMENT` clause | Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a top-level element in a registered XML Schema. |
| X263, XML type: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause | Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a top-level element in the "no name" namespace of a registered XML Schema. |
| X264, XML type: schema location | Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a registered XML Schema that is identified by a schema location. |
| X271, XMLValidate: data driven case | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and supports the data-driven case. |
| X272, XMLValidate: `ACCORDING` `TO` clause | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular registered XML Schema. |
| X273, XMLValidate: `ELEMENT` clause | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular element of a particular registered XML Schema. |
| X274, XMLValidate: schema location | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular registered XML Schema by its schema location URL. |
| X281, XMLValidate with `DOCUMENT` option | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate. `SCHEMAVALIDATE` performs validation only of XML documents (not content). |
| X286, XMLValidate: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause | The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular element in the "no name" namespace of a particular registered XML Schema. |
| X300, `XMLTable` | Oracle does not support reverse axes in the column path expressions. Aside from that restriction, Oracle fully supports the following elements of this feature:   * X086, XML namespace declarations in `XMLTable` * X302, `XMLTable` with ordinality column * X303, `XMLTable`: column default option * X304, `XMLTable`: passing a context item * X305, `XMLTable`: initializing an XQuery variable   Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on individual arguments. |
| X302, `XMLTable` with ordinality column | See X300. |
| X303, `XMLTable`: column default option | See X300. |
| X304, `XMLTable`: passing a context item | See X300. |
| X305, `XMLTable`: initializing an XQuery variable | See X300. |
