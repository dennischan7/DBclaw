# Oracle 21c - ALTER-DIMENSION
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/ALTER-DIMENSION.html

Prerequisites

The dimension must be in your schema or you must have the `ALTER` `ANY` `DIMENSION` system privilege to use this statement.

A dimension is always altered under the rights of the owner.

Semantics

The following keywords, parameters, and clauses have meaning unique to `ALTER` `DIMENSION`. Keywords, parameters, and clauses that do not appear here have the same functionality that they have in the `CREATE` `DIMENSION` statement. Refer to [CREATE DIMENSION](CREATE-DIMENSION.md#GUID-E6CD4CFC-5D06-4A8F-9DF1-C609A7EB8413) for more information.

dimension

Specify the name of the dimension. This dimension must already exist.

ADD

The `ADD` clauses let you add a level, hierarchy, or attribute to the dimension. Adding one of these elements does not invalidate any existing materialized view.

Oracle Database processes `ADD` `LEVEL` clauses prior to any other `ADD` clauses.

DROP

The `DROP` clauses let you drop a level, hierarchy, or attribute from the dimension. Any level, hierarchy, or attribute you specify must already exist.

Within one attribute, you can drop one or more level-to-column relationships associated with one level.

Restriction on DROP

If any attributes or hierarchies reference a level, then you cannot drop the level until you either drop all the referencing attributes and hierarchies or specify `CASCADE`.

CASCADE

Specify `CASCADE` if you want Oracle Database to drop any attributes or hierarchies that reference the level, along with the level itself.

RESTRICT

Specify `RESTRICT` if you want to prevent Oracle Database from dropping a level that is referenced by any attributes or hierarchies. This is the default.

COMPILE

Specify `COMPILE` to explicitly recompile an invalidated dimension. Oracle Database automatically compiles a dimension when you issue an `ADD` clause or `DROP` clause. However, if you alter an object referenced by the dimension (for example, if you drop and then re-create a table referenced in the dimension), Oracle Database invalidates, and you must recompile it explicitly.

Examples

Modifying a Dimension: Examples

The following examples modify the `customers_dim` dimension in the sample schema `sh`:

```
ALTER DIMENSION customers_dim
   DROP ATTRIBUTE country;

ALTER DIMENSION customers_dim
   ADD LEVEL zone IS customers.cust_postal_code
   ADD ATTRIBUTE zone DETERMINES (cust_city);
```
