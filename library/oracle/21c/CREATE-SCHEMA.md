# Oracle 21c - CREATE-SCHEMA
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/CREATE-SCHEMA.html

Purpose

Use the `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement to create multiple tables and views and perform multiple grants in your own schema in a single transaction.

To execute a `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement, Oracle Database executes each included statement. If all statements execute successfully, then the database commits the transaction. If any statement results in an error, then the database rolls back all the statements.

Note:

This statement does not actually create a schema. Oracle Database automatically creates a schema when you create a user (see [CREATE USER](CREATE-USER.md#GUID-F0246961-558F-480B-AC0F-14B50134621C)). This statement lets you populate your schema with tables and views and grant privileges on those objects without having to issue multiple SQL statements in multiple transactions.

Prerequisites

The `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement can include `CREATE` `TABLE`, `CREATE` `VIEW`, and `GRANT` statements. To issue a `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement, you must have the privileges necessary to issue the included statements.

schema

Specify the name of the schema. The schema name must be the same as your Oracle Database username.

Restrictions

While `CREATE SCHEMA` supports `CREATE TABLE` , `CREATE BLOCKCHAIN TABLE` is unsupported.

create\_table\_statement

Specify a `CREATE` `TABLE` statement to be issued as part of this `CREATE SCHEMA` statement. Do not end this statement with a semicolon (or other terminator character).

create\_view\_statement

Specify a `CREATE` `VIEW` statement to be issued as part of this `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement. Do not end this statement with a semicolon (or other terminator character).

grant\_statement

Specify a `GRANT` statement to be issued as part of this `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement. Do not end this statement with a semicolon (or other terminator character). You can use this clause to grant object privileges on objects you own to other users. You can also grant system privileges to other users if you were granted those privileges `WITH` `ADMIN` `OPTION`.

The `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement supports the syntax of these statements only as defined by standard SQL, rather than the complete syntax supported by Oracle Database.

The order in which you list the `CREATE` `TABLE`, `CREATE` `VIEW`, and `GRANT` statements is unimportant. The statements within a `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement can reference existing objects or objects you create in other statements within the same `CREATE` `SCHEMA` statement.

Restriction on Granting Privileges to a Schema

The syntax of the `parallel_clause` is allowed for a `CREATE` `TABLE` statement in `CREATE` `SCHEMA`, but parallelism is not used when creating the objects.

Examples

Creating a Schema: Example

The following statement creates a schema named `oe` for the sample order entry user `oe`, creates the table `new_product`, creates the view `new_product_view`, and grants the `SELECT` object privilege on `new_product_view` to the sample human resources user `hr`.

```
CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION oe
   CREATE TABLE new_product 
      (color VARCHAR2(10)  PRIMARY KEY, quantity NUMBER) 
   CREATE VIEW new_product_view 
      AS SELECT color, quantity FROM new_product WHERE color = 'RED' 
   GRANT select ON new_product_view TO hr;
```
