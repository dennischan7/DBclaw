# Oracle 21c - GROUPING
Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/GROUPING.html

`GROUPING` distinguishes superaggregate rows from regular grouped rows. `GROUP` `BY` extensions such as `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` produce superaggregate rows where the set of all values is represented by null. Using the `GROUPING` function, you can distinguish a null representing the set of all values in a superaggregate row from a null in a regular row.

The `expr` in the `GROUPING` function must match one of the expressions in the `GROUP` `BY` clause. The function returns a value of 1 if the value of `expr` in the row is a null representing the set of all values. Otherwise, it returns zero. The data type of the value returned by the `GROUPING` function is Oracle `NUMBER`. Refer to the `SELECT` [group\_by\_clause](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2182483) for a discussion of these terms.

In the following example, which uses the sample tables `hr.departments` and `hr.employees`, if the `GROUPING` function returns 1 (indicating a superaggregate row rather than a regular row from the table), then the string "All Jobs" appears in the "JOB" column instead of the null that would otherwise appear:

```
SELECT 
    DECODE(GROUPING(department_name), 1, 'ALL DEPARTMENTS', department_name)
      AS department,
    DECODE(GROUPING(job_id), 1, 'All Jobs', job_id) AS job,
    COUNT(*) "Total Empl",
    AVG(salary) * 12 "Average Sal"
  FROM employees e, departments d
  WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
  GROUP BY ROLLUP (department_name, job_id)
  ORDER BY department, job;
