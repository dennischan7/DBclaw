This section describes the storage format at the level of files and directories.

Traditionally, the configuration and data files used by a database cluster are stored together within the cluster's data directory, commonly referred to as PGDATA (after the name of the environment variable that can be used to define it). A common location for PGDATA is /var/lib/pgsql/data. Multiple clusters, managed by different server instances, can exist on the same machine.

The PGDATA directory contains several subdirectories and control files, as shown in [Table 73.1.](#page-161-0) In addition to these required items, the cluster configuration files postgresql.conf, pg\_hba.conf, and pg\_ident.conf are traditionally stored in PGDATA, although it is possible to place them elsewhere.

For each database in the cluster there is a subdirectory within PGDATA/base, named after the database's OID in pg\_database. This subdirectory is the default location for the database's files; in particular, its system catalogs are stored there.

Note that the following sections describe the behavior of the builtin heap [table access method,](#page-81-0) and the builtin [index access methods](#page-82-0). Due to the extensible nature of PostgreSQL, other access methods might work differently.

Each table and index is stored in a separate file. For ordinary relations, these files are named after the table or index's *filenode* number, which can be found in pg\_class.relfilenode. But for temporary relations, the file name is of the form tBBB\_FFF, where BBB is the backend ID of the backend which created the file, and FFF is the filenode number. In either case, in addition to the main file (a/k/a main fork), each table and index has a *free space map* (see [Section 73.3\)](#page-166-0), which stores information about free space available in the relation. The free space map is stored in a file named with the filenode number plus the suffix \_fsm. Tables also have a *visibility map*, stored in a fork with the suffix \_vm, to track which pages are known to have no dead tuples. The visibility map is described further in [Section 73.4](#page-166-1). Unlogged tables and indexes have a third fork, known as the initialization fork, which is stored in a fork with the suffix \_init (see [Section 73.5](#page-167-1)).

#### **Caution**

Note that while a table's filenode often matches its OID, this is *not* necessarily the case; some operations, like TRUNCATE, REINDEX, CLUSTER and some forms of ALTER TA-BLE, can change the filenode while preserving the OID. Avoid assuming that filenode and table OID are the same. Also, for certain system catalogs including pg\_class itself, pg\_class.relfilenode contains zero. The actual filenode number of these catalogs is stored in a lower-level data structure, and can be obtained using the pg\_relation\_filenode() function.

When a table or index exceeds 1 GB, it is divided into gigabyte-sized *segments*. The first segment's file name is the same as the filenode; subsequent segments are named filenode.1, filenode.2, etc. This arrangement avoids problems on platforms that have file size limitations. (Actually, 1 GB is just the default segment size. The segment size can be adjusted using the configuration option --withsegsize when building PostgreSQL.) In principle, free space map and visibility map forks could require multiple segments as well, though this is unlikely to happen in practice.

A table that has columns with potentially large entries will have an associated *TOAST* table, which is used for out-of-line storage of field values that are too large to keep in the table rows proper. pg\_class.reltoastrelid links from a table to its TOAST table, if any. See [Section 73.2](#page-163-0) for more information.

The contents of tables and indexes are discussed further in [Section 73.6](#page-167-0).

Tablespaces make the scenario more complicated. Each user-defined tablespace has a symbolic link inside the PGDATA/pg\_tblspc directory, which points to the physical tablespace directory (i.e., the location specified in the tablespace's CREATE TABLESPACE command). This symbolic link is named after the tablespace's OID. Inside the physical tablespace directory there is a subdirectory with a name that depends on the PostgreSQL server version, such as PG\_9.0\_201008051. (The reason for using this subdirectory is so that successive versions of the database can use the same CREATE TABLESPACE location value without conflicts.) Within the version-specific subdirectory, there is a subdirectory for each database that has elements in the tablespace, named after the database's OID. Tables and indexes are stored within that directory, using the filenode naming scheme. The pg\_default tablespace is not accessed through pg\_tblspc, but corresponds to PGDATA/base. Similarly, the pg\_global tablespace is not accessed through pg\_tblspc, but corresponds to PGDA-TA/global.

The pg\_relation\_filepath() function shows the entire path (relative to PGDATA) of any relation. It is often useful as a substitute for remembering many of the above rules. But keep in mind that this function just gives the name of the first segment of the main fork of the relation — you may need to append a segment number and/or \_fsm, \_vm, or \_init to find all the files associated with the relation.

Temporary files (for operations such as sorting more data than can fit in memory) are created within PGDATA/base/pgsql\_tmp, or within a pgsql\_tmp subdirectory of a tablespace directory if a tablespace other than pg\_default is specified for them. The name of a temporary file has the form pgsql\_tmpPPP.NNN, where PPP is the PID of the owning backend and NNN distinguishes different temporary files of that backend.

# <span id="page-163-0"></span>**73.2. TOAST**

This section provides an overview of TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique).

PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store very large field values directly. To overcome this limitation, large field values are compressed and/or broken up into multiple physical rows. This happens transparently to the user, with only small impact on most of the backend code. The technique is affectionately known as TOAST (or "the best thing since sliced bread"). The TOAST infrastructure is also used to improve handling of large data values in-memory.

Only certain data types support TOAST — there is no need to impose the overhead on data types that cannot produce large field values. To support TOAST, a data type must have a variable-length (*varlena*) representation, in which, ordinarily, the first four-byte word of any stored value contains the total length of the value in bytes (including itself). TOAST does not constrain the rest of the data type's representation. The special representations collectively called *TOASTed values* work by modifying or reinterpreting this initial length word. Therefore, the C-level functions supporting a TOAST-able data type must be careful about how they handle potentially TOASTed input values: an input might not actually consist of a four-byte length word and contents until after it's been *detoasted*. (This is normally done by invoking PG\_DETOAST\_DATUM before doing anything with an input value, but in some cases more efficient approaches are possible. See Section 38.13.1 for more detail.)

TOAST usurps two bits of the varlena length word (the high-order bits on big-endian machines, the low-order bits on little-endian machines), thereby limiting the logical size of any value of a TOASTable data type to 1 GB (230 - 1 bytes). When both bits are zero, the value is an ordinary un-TOASTed value of the data type, and the remaining bits of the length word give the total datum size (including length word) in bytes. When the highest-order or lowest-order bit is set, the value has only a single-byte header instead of the normal four-byte header, and the remaining bits of that byte give the total datum size (including length byte) in bytes. This alternative supports space-efficient storage of values shorter than 127 bytes, while still allowing the data type to grow to 1 GB at need. Values with single-byte headers aren't aligned on any particular boundary, whereas values with four-byte headers are aligned on at least a four-byte boundary; this omission of alignment padding provides additional space savings that is significant compared to short values. As a special case, if the remaining bits of a single-byte header are all zero (which would be impossible for a self-inclusive length), the value is a pointer to out-of-line data, with several possible alternatives as described below. The type and size of such a *TOAST pointer* are determined by a code stored in the second byte of the datum. Lastly, when the highest-order or lowest-order bit is clear but the adjacent bit is set, the content of the datum has been compressed and must be decompressed before use. In this case the remaining bits of the four-byte length word give the total size of the compressed datum, not the original data. Note that compression is also possible for out-of-line data but the varlena header does not tell whether it has occurred — the content of the TOAST pointer tells that, instead.

The compression technique used for either in-line or out-of-line compressed data can be selected for each column by setting the COMPRESSION column option in CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE. The default for columns with no explicit setting is to consult the default\_toast\_compression parameter at the time data is inserted.

As mentioned, there are multiple types of TOAST pointer datums. The oldest and most common type is a pointer to out-of-line data stored in a *TOAST table* that is separate from, but associated with, the table containing the TOAST pointer datum itself. These *on-disk* pointer datums are created by the TOAST management code (in access/common/toast\_internals.c) when a tuple to be stored on disk is too large to be stored as-is. Further details appear in [Section 73.2.1](#page-164-0). Alternatively, a TOAST pointer datum can contain a pointer to out-of-line data that appears elsewhere in memory. Such datums are necessarily short-lived, and will never appear on-disk, but they are very useful for avoiding copying and redundant processing of large data values. Further details appear in [Section 73.2.2.](#page-165-0)

### <span id="page-164-0"></span>**73.2.1. Out-of-Line, On-Disk TOAST Storage**

If any of the columns of a table are TOAST-able, the table will have an associated TOAST table, whose OID is stored in the table's pg\_class.reltoastrelid entry. On-disk TOASTed values are kept in the TOAST table, as described in more detail below.

Out-of-line values are divided (after compression if used) into chunks of at most TOAST\_MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE bytes (by default this value is chosen so that four chunk rows will fit on a page, making it about 2000 bytes). Each chunk is stored as a separate row in the TOAST table belonging to the owning table. Every TOAST table has the columns chunk\_id (an OID identifying the particular TOASTed value), chunk\_seq (a sequence number for the chunk within its value), and chunk\_data (the actual data of the chunk). A unique index on chunk\_id and chunk\_seq provides fast retrieval of the values. A pointer datum representing an out-of-line on-disk TOASTed value therefore needs to store the OID of the TOAST table in which to look and the OID of the specific value (its chunk\_id). For convenience, pointer datums also store the logical datum size (original uncompressed data length), physical stored size (different if compression was applied), and the compression method used, if any. Allowing for the varlena header bytes, the total size of an on-disk TOAST pointer datum is therefore 18 bytes regardless of the actual size of the represented value.

The TOAST management code is triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than TOAST\_TUPLE\_THRESHOLD bytes (normally 2 kB). The TOAST code will compress and/or move field values out-of-line until the row value is shorter than TOAST\_TUPLE\_TARGET bytes (also normally 2 kB, adjustable) or no more gains can be had. During an UPDATE operation, values of unchanged fields are normally preserved as-is; so an UPDATE of a row with out-of-line values incurs no TOAST costs if none of the out-of-line values change.

The TOAST management code recognizes four different strategies for storing TOAST-able columns on disk:

- PLAIN prevents either compression or out-of-line storage. This is the only possible strategy for columns of non-TOAST-able data types.
- EXTENDED allows both compression and out-of-line storage. This is the default for most TOASTable data types. Compression will be attempted first, then out-of-line storage if the row is still too big.
- EXTERNAL allows out-of-line storage but not compression. Use of EXTERNAL will make substring operations on wide text and bytea columns faster (at the penalty of increased storage space) because these operations are optimized to fetch only the required parts of the out-of-line value when it is not compressed.
- MAIN allows compression but not out-of-line storage. (Actually, out-of-line storage will still be performed for such columns, but only as a last resort when there is no other way to make the row small enough to fit on a page.)

Each TOAST-able data type specifies a default strategy for columns of that data type, but the strategy for a given table column can be altered with ALTER TABLE ... SET STORAGE.

```
TOAST_TUPLE_TARGET can be adjusted for each table using ALTER TABLE ... SET
(toast_tuple_target = N)
```

This scheme has a number of advantages compared to a more straightforward approach such as allowing row values to span pages. Assuming that queries are usually qualified by comparisons against relatively small key values, most of the work of the executor will be done using the main row entry. The big values of TOASTed attributes will only be pulled out (if selected at all) at the time the result set is sent to the client. Thus, the main table is much smaller and more of its rows fit in the shared buffer cache than would be the case without any out-of-line storage. Sort sets shrink also, and sorts will more often be done entirely in memory. A little test showed that a table containing typical HTML pages and their URLs was stored in about half of the raw data size including the TOAST table, and that the main table contained only about 10% of the entire data (the URLs and some small HTML pages). There was no run time difference compared to an un-TOASTed comparison table, in which all the HTML pages were cut down to 7 kB to fit.

### <span id="page-165-0"></span>**73.2.2. Out-of-Line, In-Memory TOAST Storage**

TOAST pointers can point to data that is not on disk, but is elsewhere in the memory of the current server process. Such pointers obviously cannot be long-lived, but they are nonetheless useful. There are currently two sub-cases: pointers to *indirect* data and pointers to *expanded* data.

Indirect TOAST pointers simply point at a non-indirect varlena value stored somewhere in memory. This case was originally created merely as a proof of concept, but it is currently used during logical decoding to avoid possibly having to create physical tuples exceeding 1 GB (as pulling all out-of-line field values into the tuple might do). The case is of limited use since the creator of the pointer datum is entirely responsible that the referenced data survives for as long as the pointer could exist, and there is no infrastructure to help with this.

Expanded TOAST pointers are useful for complex data types whose on-disk representation is not especially suited for computational purposes. As an example, the standard varlena representation of a PostgreSQL array includes dimensionality information, a nulls bitmap if there are any null elements, then the values of all the elements in order. When the element type itself is variable-length, the only way to find the N'th element is to scan through all the preceding elements. This representation is appropriate for on-disk storage because of its compactness, but for computations with the array it's much nicer to have an "expanded" or "deconstructed" representation in which all the element starting locations have been identified. The TOAST pointer mechanism supports this need by allowing a pass-by-reference Datum to point to either a standard varlena value (the on-disk representation) or a TOAST pointer that points to an expanded representation somewhere in memory. The details of this expanded representation are up to the data type, though it must have a standard header and meet the other API requirements given in src/include/utils/expandeddatum.h. C-level functions working with the data type can choose to handle either representation. Functions that do not know about the expanded representation, but simply apply PG\_DETOAST\_DATUM to their inputs, will automatically receive the traditional varlena representation; so support for an expanded representation can be introduced incrementally, one function at a time.

TOAST pointers to expanded values are further broken down into *read-write* and *read-only* pointers. The pointed-to representation is the same either way, but a function that receives a read-write pointer is allowed to modify the referenced value in-place, whereas one that receives a read-only pointer must not; it must first create a copy if it wants to make a modified version of the value. This distinction and some associated conventions make it possible to avoid unnecessary copying of expanded values during query execution.

For all types of in-memory TOAST pointer, the TOAST management code ensures that no such pointer datum can accidentally get stored on disk. In-memory TOAST pointers are automatically expanded to normal in-line varlena values before storage — and then possibly converted to on-disk TOAST pointers, if the containing tuple would otherwise be too big.

# <span id="page-166-0"></span>**73.3. Free Space Map**

Each heap and index relation, except for hash indexes, has a Free Space Map (FSM) to keep track of available space in the relation. It's stored alongside the main relation data in a separate relation fork, named after the filenode number of the relation, plus a \_fsm suffix. For example, if the filenode of a relation is 12345, the FSM is stored in a file called 12345\_fsm, in the same directory as the main relation file.

The Free Space Map is organized as a tree of FSM pages. The bottom level FSM pages store the free space available on each heap (or index) page, using one byte to represent each such page. The upper levels aggregate information from the lower levels.

Within each FSM page is a binary tree, stored in an array with one byte per node. Each leaf node represents a heap page, or a lower level FSM page. In each non-leaf node, the higher of its children's values is stored. The maximum value in the leaf nodes is therefore stored at the root.

See src/backend/storage/freespace/README for more details on how the FSM is structured, and how it's updated and searched. The pg\_freespacemap module can be used to examine the information stored in free space maps.

# <span id="page-166-1"></span>**73.4. Visibility Map**

Each heap relation has a Visibility Map (VM) to keep track of which pages contain only tuples that are known to be visible to all active transactions; it also keeps track of which pages contain only frozen tuples. It's stored alongside the main relation data in a separate relation fork, named after the filenode number of the relation, plus a \_vm suffix. For example, if the filenode of a relation is 12345, the VM is stored in a file called 12345\_vm, in the same directory as the main relation file. Note that indexes do not have VMs.

The visibility map stores two bits per heap page. The first bit, if set, indicates that the page is all-visible, or in other words that the page does not contain any tuples that need to be vacuumed. This information can also be used by *index-only scans* to answer queries using only the index tuple. The second bit, if set, means that all tuples on the page have been frozen. That means that even an anti-wraparound vacuum need not revisit the page.

The map is conservative in the sense that we make sure that whenever a bit is set, we know the condition is true, but if a bit is not set, it might or might not be true. Visibility map bits are only set by vacuum, but are cleared by any data-modifying operations on a page.

The pg\_visibility module can be used to examine the information stored in the visibility map.

# <span id="page-167-1"></span>**73.5. The Initialization Fork**

Each unlogged table, and each index on an unlogged table, has an initialization fork. The initialization fork is an empty table or index of the appropriate type. When an unlogged table must be reset to empty due to a crash, the initialization fork is copied over the main fork, and any other forks are erased (they will be recreated automatically as needed).

# <span id="page-167-0"></span>**73.6. Database Page Layout**

This section provides an overview of the page format used within PostgreSQL tables and indexes.<sup>1</sup> Sequences and TOAST tables are formatted just like a regular table.

In the following explanation, a *byte* is assumed to contain 8 bits. In addition, the term *item* refers to an individual data value that is stored on a page. In a table, an item is a row; in an index, an item is an index entry.

Every table and index is stored as an array of *pages* of a fixed size (usually 8 kB, although a different page size can be selected when compiling the server). In a table, all the pages are logically equivalent, so a particular item (row) can be stored in any page. In indexes, the first page is generally reserved as a *metapage* holding control information, and there can be different types of pages within the index, depending on the index access method.

[Table 73.2](#page-167-2) shows the overall layout of a page. There are five parts to each page.

<span id="page-167-2"></span>**Table 73.2. Overall Page Layout**

| Item           | Description                                                                                                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PageHeaderData | 24 bytes long. Contains general information<br>about the page, including free space pointers.                           |
| ItemIdData     | Array of item identifiers pointing to the actu<br>al items. Each entry is an (offset,length) pair. 4<br>bytes per item. |
| Free space     | The unallocated space. New item identifiers are<br>allocated from the start of this area, new items<br>from the end.    |
| Items          | The actual items themselves.                                                                                            |
| Special space  | Index access method specific data. Different<br>methods store different data. Empty in ordinary<br>tables.              |

The first 24 bytes of each page consists of a page header (PageHeaderData). Its format is detailed in [Table 73.3](#page-168-0). The first field tracks the most recent WAL entry related to this page. The second field contains the page checksum if data checksums are enabled. Next is a 2-byte field containing flag bits. This is followed by three 2-byte integer fields (pd\_lower, pd\_upper, and pd\_special). These contain byte offsets from the page start to the start of unallocated space, to the end of unallocated space, and to the start of the special space. The next 2 bytes of the page header, pd\_pagesize\_version, store both the page size and a version indicator. Beginning with PostgreSQL 8.3 the version number is 4; PostgreSQL 8.1 and 8.2 used version number 3; PostgreSQL 8.0 used version number 2; PostgreSQL 7.3 and 7.4 used version number 1; prior releases used version number 0. (The basic page

Actually, use of this page format is not required for either table or index access methods. The heap table access method always uses this format. All the existing index methods also use the basic format, but the data kept on index metapages usually doesn't follow the item layout rules.

layout and header format has not changed in most of these versions, but the layout of heap row headers has.) The page size is basically only present as a cross-check; there is no support for having more than one page size in an installation. The last field is a hint that shows whether pruning the page is likely to be profitable: it tracks the oldest un-pruned XMAX on the page.

All the details can be found in src/include/storage/bufpage.h.

Following the page header are item identifiers (ItemIdData), each requiring four bytes. An item identifier contains a byte-offset to the start of an item, its length in bytes, and a few attribute bits which affect its interpretation. New item identifiers are allocated as needed from the beginning of the unallocated space. The number of item identifiers present can be determined by looking at pd\_lower, which is increased to allocate a new identifier. Because an item identifier is never moved until it is freed, its index can be used on a long-term basis to reference an item, even when the item itself is moved around on the page to compact free space. In fact, every pointer to an item (ItemPointer, also known as CTID) created by PostgreSQL consists of a page number and the index of an item identifier.

The items themselves are stored in space allocated backwards from the end of unallocated space. The exact structure varies depending on what the table is to contain. Tables and sequences both use a structure named HeapTupleHeaderData, described below.

The final section is the "special section" which can contain anything the access method wishes to store. For example, b-tree indexes store links to the page's left and right siblings, as well as some other data relevant to the index structure. Ordinary tables do not use a special section at all (indicated by setting pd\_special to equal the page size).

[Figure 73.1](#page-169-0) illustrates how these parts are laid out in a page.

### **73.6.1. Table Row Layout**

All table rows are structured in the same way. There is a fixed-size header (occupying 23 bytes on most machines), followed by an optional null bitmap, an optional object ID field, and the user data. The header is detailed in [Table 73.4.](#page-169-1) The actual user data (columns of the row) begins at the offset indicated by t\_hoff, which must always be a multiple of the MAXALIGN distance for the platform. The null bitmap is only present if the *HEAP\_HASNULL* bit is set in t\_infomask. If it is present it begins just after the fixed header and occupies enough bytes to have one bit per data column (that is, the number of bits that equals the attribute count in t\_infomask2). In this list of bits, a 1 bit indicates not-null, a 0 bit is a null. When the bitmap is not present, all columns are assumed not-null. The object ID is only present if the *HEAP\_HASOID\_OLD* bit is set in t\_infomask. If present, it appears just before the t\_hoff boundary. Any padding needed to make t\_hoff a MAXALIGN multiple will appear between the null bitmap and the object ID. (This in turn ensures that the object ID is suitably aligned.)

All the details can be found in src/include/access/htup\_details.h.

Interpreting the actual data can only be done with information obtained from other tables, mostly pg\_attribute. The key values needed to identify field locations are attlen and attalign. There is no way to directly get a particular attribute, except when there are only fixed width fields and no null values. All this trickery is wrapped up in the functions *heap\_getattr*, *fastgetattr* and *heap\_getsysattr*.

To read the data you need to examine each attribute in turn. First check whether the field is NULL according to the null bitmap. If it is, go to the next. Then make sure you have the right alignment. If the field is a fixed width field, then all the bytes are simply placed. If it's a variable length field (attlen = -1) then it's a bit more complicated. All variable-length data types share the common header structure struct varlena, which includes the total length of the stored value and some flag bits. Depending on the flags, the data can be either inline or in a TOAST table; it might be compressed, too (see [Section 73.2\)](#page-163-0).

# <span id="page-170-0"></span>**73.7. Heap-Only Tuples (HOT)**

To allow for high concurrency, PostgreSQL uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) to store rows. However, MVCC has some downsides for update queries. Specifically, updates require new versions of rows to be added to tables. This can also require new index entries for each updated row, and removal of old versions of rows and their index entries can be expensive.

To help reduce the overhead of updates, PostgreSQL has an optimization called heap-only tuples (HOT). This optimization is possible when:

- The update does not modify any columns referenced by the table's indexes, not including summarizing indexes. The only summarizing index method in the core PostgreSQL distribution is [BRIN](#page-146-0).
- There is sufficient free space on the page containing the old row for the updated row.

In such cases, heap-only tuples provide two optimizations:

- New index entries are not needed to represent updated rows, however, summary indexes may still need to be updated.
- Old versions of updated rows can be completely removed during normal operation, including SELECTs, instead of requiring periodic vacuum operations. (This is possible because indexes do not reference their [page item identifiers](#page-167-0).)

You can increase the likelihood of sufficient page space for HOT updates by decreasing a table's fillfactor. If you don't, HOT updates will still happen because new rows will naturally migrate to new pages and existing pages with sufficient free space for new row versions. The system view pg\_stat\_all\_tables allows monitoring of the occurrence of HOT and non-HOT updates.
