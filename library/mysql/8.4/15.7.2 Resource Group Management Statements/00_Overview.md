MySQL supports creation and management of resource groups, and permits assigning threads running within the server to particular groups so that threads execute according to the resources available to the group. This section describes the SQL statements available for resource group management. For general discussion of the resource group capability, see Section 7.1.16, "Resource Groups".

## <span id="page-63-0"></span>**15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement**

```
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP group_name
 [VCPU [=] vcpu_spec [, vcpu_spec] ...]
 [THREAD_PRIORITY [=] N]
 [ENABLE|DISABLE [FORCE]]
```

```
vcpu_spec: {N | M - N}
```

[ALTER RESOURCE GROUP](#page-63-0) is used for resource group management (see Section 7.1.16, "Resource Groups"). This statement alters modifiable attributes of an existing resource group. It requires the RESOURCE\_GROUP\_ADMIN privilege.

group\_name identifies which resource group to alter. If the group does not exist, an error occurs.

The attributes for CPU affinity, priority, and whether the group is enabled can be modified with [ALTER](#page-63-0) [RESOURCE GROUP](#page-63-0). These attributes are specified the same way as described for [CREATE RESOURCE](#page-64-0) [GROUP](#page-64-0) (see [Section 15.7.2.2, "CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement"](#page-64-0)). Only the attributes specified are altered. Unspecified attributes retain their current values.

The FORCE modifier is used with DISABLE. It determines statement behavior if the resource group has any threads assigned to it:

- If FORCE is not given, existing threads in the group continue to run until they terminate, but new threads cannot be assigned to the group.
- If FORCE is given, existing threads in the group are moved to their respective default group (system threads to SYS\_default, user threads to USR\_default).

The name and type attributes are set at group creation time and cannot be modified thereafter with [ALTER RESOURCE GROUP](#page-63-0).

#### Examples:

• Alter a group CPU affinity:

```
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg1 VCPU = 0-63;
```

• Alter a group thread priority:

```
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg2 THREAD_PRIORITY = 5;
```

• Disable a group, moving any threads assigned to it to the default groups:

```
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg3 DISABLE FORCE;
```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs. [ALTER RESOURCE GROUP](#page-63-0) statements are not written to the binary log and are not replicated.

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>**15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement**

```
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP group_name
 TYPE = {SYSTEM|USER}
 [VCPU [=] vcpu_spec [, vcpu_spec] ...]
 [THREAD_PRIORITY [=] N]
 [ENABLE|DISABLE]
vcpu_spec: {N | M - N}
```

[CREATE RESOURCE GROUP](#page-64-0) is used for resource group management (see Section 7.1.16, "Resource Groups"). This statement creates a new resource group and assigns its initial attribute values. It requires the RESOURCE\_GROUP\_ADMIN privilege.

group\_name identifies which resource group to create. If the group already exists, an error occurs.

The TYPE attribute is required. It should be SYSTEM for a system resource group, USER for a user resource group. The group type affects permitted THREAD\_PRIORITY values, as described later.

The VCPU attribute indicates the CPU affinity; that is, the set of virtual CPUs the group can use:

- If VCPU is not given, the resource group has no CPU affinity and can use all available CPUs.
- If VCPU is given, the attribute value is a list of comma-separated CPU numbers or ranges:
  - Each number must be an integer in the range from 0 to the number of CPUs − 1. For example, on a system with 64 CPUs, the number can range from 0 to 63.
  - A range is given in the form M − N, where M is less than or equal to N and both numbers are in the CPU range.
  - If a CPU number is an integer outside the permitted range or is not an integer, an error occurs.

Example VCPU specifiers (these are all equivalent):

```
VCPU = 0,1,2,3,9,10
VCPU = 0-3,9-10
VCPU = 9,10,0-3
VCPU = 0,10,1,9,3,2
```

The THREAD\_PRIORITY attribute indicates the priority for threads assigned to the group:

- If THREAD\_PRIORITY is not given, the default priority is 0.
- If THREAD\_PRIORITY is given, the attribute value must be in the range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). The priority for system resource groups must be in the range from -20 to 0. The priority for user resource groups must be in the range from 0 to 19. Use of different ranges for system and user groups ensures that user threads never have a higher priority than system threads.

ENABLE and DISABLE specify that the resource group is initially enabled or disabled. If neither is specified, the group is enabled by default. A disabled group cannot have threads assigned to it.

#### Examples:

• Create an enabled user group that has a single CPU and the lowest priority:

```
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg1
 TYPE = USER
 VCPU = 0
 THREAD_PRIORITY = 19;
```

• Create a disabled system group that has no CPU affinity (can use all CPUs) and the highest priority:

```
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg2
 TYPE = SYSTEM
 THREAD_PRIORITY = -20
 DISABLE;
```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs. [CREATE RESOURCE GROUP](#page-64-0) statements are not written to the binary log and are not replicated.

## <span id="page-65-0"></span>**15.7.2.3 DROP RESOURCE GROUP Statement**

```
DROP RESOURCE GROUP group_name [FORCE]
```

[DROP RESOURCE GROUP](#page-65-0) is used for resource group management (see Section 7.1.16, "Resource Groups"). This statement drops a resource group. It requires the RESOURCE\_GROUP\_ADMIN privilege.

group\_name identifies which resource group to drop. If the group does not exist, an error occurs.

The FORCE modifier determines statement behavior if the resource group has any threads assigned to it:

• If FORCE is not given and any threads are assigned to the group, an error occurs.

• If FORCE is given, existing threads in the group are moved to their respective default group (system threads to SYS\_default, user threads to USR\_default).

#### Examples:

• Drop a group, failing if the group contains any threads:

```
DROP RESOURCE GROUP rg1;
```

• Drop a group and move existing threads to the default groups:

```
DROP RESOURCE GROUP rg2 FORCE;
```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs. [DROP RESOURCE GROUP](#page-65-0) statements are not written to the binary log and are not replicated.

## <span id="page-66-0"></span>**15.7.2.4 SET RESOURCE GROUP Statement**

```
SET RESOURCE GROUP group_name
 [FOR thread_id [, thread_id] ...]
```

[SET RESOURCE GROUP](#page-66-0) is used for resource group management (see Section 7.1.16, "Resource Groups"). This statement assigns threads to a resource group. It requires the RESOURCE\_GROUP\_ADMIN or RESOURCE\_GROUP\_USER privilege.

group\_name identifies which resource group to be assigned. Any thread\_id values indicate threads to assign to the group. Thread IDs can be determined from the Performance Schema threads table. If the resource group or any named thread ID does not exist, an error occurs.

With no FOR clause, the statement assigns the current thread for the session to the resource group.

With a FOR clause that names thread IDs, the statement assigns those threads to the resource group.

For attempts to assign a system thread to a user resource group or a user thread to a system resource group, a warning occurs.

#### Examples:

• Assign the current session thread to a group:

```
SET RESOURCE GROUP rg1;
```

• Assign the named threads to a group:

```
SET RESOURCE GROUP rg2 FOR 14, 78, 4;
```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it occurs. [SET RESOURCE GROUP](#page-66-0) statements are not written to the binary log and are not replicated.

An alternative to [SET RESOURCE GROUP](#page-66-0) is the RESOURCE\_GROUP optimizer hint, which assigns individual statements to a resource group. See Section 10.9.3, "Optimizer Hints".
